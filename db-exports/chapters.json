  "description": "Twelve years ago, a vicious tailed beast known as the Nine-Tails attacked the shinobi village of Konohagakure. Many shinobi fought the beast, but it defeated and killed all those that stood in front of it. The village was saved when its leader, the Fourth Hokage, sealed the beast with an infant boy at the cost of his own life.\nIn the present, Naruto Uzumaki is a prankster who is constantly causing trouble throughout Konohagakure, most recently having placed graffiti all over the Hokage Rock. Much of the village dislikes him, but he enjoys the attention garnered from reprimands, as he had no parents or friends due to the villagers abusing him daily. Despite claiming to be a talented shinobi who would someday become Hokage, Naruto is incapable of performing basic techniques such as the Clone Technique. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the Academy, one of his instructors, Mizuki, tells Naruto that if he could steal the Scroll of Seals and learn one of its secret techniques, he would be allowed to continue on to the ranks of the ninja anyway and graduate.\nAfter successfully stealing the scroll, Naruto is caught by another instructor, Iruka Umino, who realised that Naruto had been tricked by Mizuki. Mizuki arrives and asks Naruto for the scroll, to which Iruka ordered Naruto not to, as Mizuki lied and only wanted the scroll for himself. Mizuki then tells Naruto that he wasn't the one lying, explaining that the reason the villagers hate him such much is due to the Nine-Tails that had been sealed inside him since the day he was born. He goes on to explain that Iruka, whose parents were killed by the Nine-Tails, must hate him the most. However, Iruka refutes the accusation, saying he did not blame Naruto for the beast's actions, and that in fact he, having grown up also craving attention, sympathised with him. Naruto believing Iruka, uses his newly-mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki.\nAmazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his own forehead protector, and says that he may one day have the potential to become the Hokage.",

  "description": "Naruto takes a bizarre photo to use for his Ninja Registration Form, causing the Third Hokage to order him to retake it. However, Naruto refuses, and tries to persuade the Third with the Sexy Technique, which gives the latter a nose bleed and falls. Suddenly, the Third's grandson comes charging into the room, wishing to challenge him for the title as Hokage, but slips and falls. Konohamaru tries to claim Naruto made him trip, angering Naruto. Konohamaru chastises Naruto, believing that since he's the grandson of the Third Hokage, Naruto wouldn't harm him. However, Naruto replies that he doesn't care and punches the boy.\nAfter Naruto leaves, Ebisu, Konohamaru's trainer, informs the boy not to let Naruto bother him, as he is beneath him. He carries on to say that if he wished to quickly be the next Hokage, he needs to stick by him. However, during his speech, Konohamaru left to follow Naruto without him noticing. Ebisu panics and rushes off to find him.\nWhile walking through Konohagakure, Naruto is followed by Konohamaru who tries to avoid being spotted. However, Naruto realises this, seeing through Konohamaru's disguises. Impressed by this, Konohamaru orders Naruto to train him. While seeming uninterested at first, after Konohamaru refers to Naruto as \"boss\", he accepts. After training, Konohamaru explains to Naruto that the reason he wants to be the next Hokage was so that people can see him as more than just the grandson of the Third Hokage.\nElsewhere, on the rooftop of the Hokage's office, the Third is seen looking up at the Fourth Hokage's monument. After Iruka appears and explains how Naruto believes that becoming a genin will change things, the Third explains that people don't change easily. The Third goes on to say that due to Naruto containing the Nine-Tailed Fox within himself, people fear the beast could take over or that Naruto may be the beast.\nEbisu finally finds Konohamaru and Naruto. Ebisu tells Konohamaru to come with him, but Konohamaru refuses. After announcing that he is learning how to beat his grandfather in order to become Hokage, Konohamaru performs the Sexy Technique. Worried that Konohamaru is becoming a delinquent due to Naruto, Ebisu tries to pull Konohamaru away with him. However, Naruto tries to stop him by using the Shadow Clone Technique to battle Ebisu. As Ebisu prepares himself, he is surprised when Naruto and his clones use the Sexy Technique, causing the latter to have a huge nose bleed and fall unconscious. Naruto then tells Konohamaru that there is no shortcut to becoming the Hokage, exclaiming that they would be rivals, and that they would fight one day for the title.",

  "description": "All of the genin graduates arrive at the Academy for their orientation. Sakura spots Sasuke sitting down and runs over to him, knocking down Naruto in the process, and asks if she could sit next to him. However, Ino comes over and states that she should be the one to sit next to Sasuke before many of the other girls do the same thing. Upset over the attention Sasuke is getting from the girls, Naruto gets on top of the desk and glares at Sasuke, with the latter returning the favour. Suddenly, Tobio accidentally bumps into Naruto, causing him to fall forward and kiss Sasuke, much to the girls' dismay. As a result, Naruto gets pummelled by them, because they were angry that they weren't Sasuke's first kiss.\nAfter Iruka arrives, he explains the next step that the genin will take, explaining that they will be in a team of three led by a jōnin. He then announces that Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke will be Team 7; Hinata, Kiba and Shino will be Team 8; and Ino, Shikamaru and Chōji will be Team 10. Naruto abruptly asks Iruka why he had to be on a team with Sasuke before being told that he had the worst scores of all the graduates, while Sasuke had the best, so in turn, they were put together to create a balanced group.\nDuring lunchtime, Sakura tries to find to Sasuke to ask him to have lunch with her to no avail. She then runs into Naruto who asks her to have lunch with him, but she coldly dismisses him. Angered yet again, Naruto ambushes Sasuke through an open window. The ending results shows Sasuke standing over a gagged and bound Naruto, but is later revealed that Sasuke only defeated a substitution before the real Naruto overpowers him with the Shadow Clone Technique. Naruto then transforms into Sasuke and heads out to find Sakura. When he finds her, he asks her what she thought of Naruto. She replies by saying that he was annoying. Sakura then leans in to kiss Sasuke, but as they are about to kiss, Sasuke is forced to go to the bathroom.\nWhen the real Sasuke manages to escape, he runs into Sakura and asks if she's seen Naruto. Brushing off what he asked, she proceeds to mock him, believing that he's so annoying because he had no parents to teach him how to behave and that he was all alone. This sparks Sasuke to remark that Sakura had no idea what it felt like to be alone before saying that she was annoying. This causes Sakura to have some resolve for Naruto, deciding to be nicer to him.\nAfter Naruto finishes using the bathroom, he runs into Sasuke, much to his surprise. Naruto uses the Shadow Clone Technique in an attempt to attack Sasuke, but is unable to proceed due to having to use the bathroom again. After finishing, he spots Sakura who is strangely being nice to him. This leads him to believe that it was Sasuke transformed as her, and is prepared to face off against her until he has to use the bathroom yet again.\nAt Naruto's house, the Third Hokage briefs Kakashi on the team he will be leading, Team 7. Kakashi examines a carton of milk and states that it was spoiled, which is the reason Naruto had to run to the bathroom so much. Kakashi then comments on how much of a problem Naruto would be.",

  "description": "Inside a classroom at the Academy, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura wait for their jōnin sensei Kakashi to arrive. As punishment for running late, Naruto decides to pull a prank on him by putting a chalkboard eraser in between the opening of the door to have it fall on him when he opens the door. Sasuke points out that an elite ninja will never fall for something like that, but to his surprise, he does, amusing Naruto and secretly Sakura as well. This action causes Kakashi to ridicule them by calling them \"idiots\", much to their dismay.\nKakashi has the team introduce themselves: Naruto says that he wants to be Hokage one day, Sakura merely blushes and glances at Sasuke, and Sasuke declares that his goal is to kill a certain somebody. Kakashi then tells them that they will undergo a survival test tomorrow morning, which will determine which of 27 graduates will be sent to the Academy, with the chances of failing being 66%. Before dismissing them, he also tells them to skip breakfast or else they'd puke.\nAt 5am the next day, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura arrive at the designated area as instructed. However, once again, Kakashi arrives late, upsetting them. Kakashi claims that a black cat passed his way so he had to go the long way. Kakashi then tells them that they will have to retrieve a bell from him by noon, and since there are only two, one of them will be not only fail but will be tied to a tree post and watch as everyone else eats. Sakura deduces that Kakashi made them skip breakfast to make the test more difficult. Once the test begins, the three of them go off and hide.\nElsewhere, Iruka discusses with the Third Hokage about his concerns of Kakashi and the training his former students will endure after hearing rumours. The Third understands and gives Iruka a book detailing the trainees who have passed and failed under Kakashi's wing. To Iruka's surprise, none of them have passed.\nBack at the training ground, just as Kakashi comments that his team has hidden well, Naruto makes his presence known and charges at him. Kakashi nonchalantly takes out his Icha Icha book and evades all of Naruto's attacks, before appearing behind him and using the One Thousand Years of Death to send him flying into the water. Naruto returns uses the Shadow Clone Technique to cleverly distract Kakashi as he had one sneak up behind him. To Naruto's surprise, as he prepares to a punch on the restrained Kakashi, Kakashi confuses Naruto having him think he turned himself into Naruto's clone. This caused the clones to attack one another, but in actuality, Kakashi used the Body Flicker Technique to switch one of Naruto's clones with himself. After Naruto disperses his clones, he spots a bell on the ground and joyfully picks it up, but it turned out to be a trap as Naruto is hung upside down by a rope attached to a tree. Kakashi appears and lectures him. Sasuke takes this opportunity to attack Kakashi from the trees with shuriken and kunai that strike the jōnin.",

  "description": "Kakashi evades Sasuke's attack with the Body Replacement Technique. After blowing his position, Sasuke moves out to avoid being found by Kakashi. A worried Sakura runs off to find Sasuke, only to be caught by Kakashi's genjutsu that made her believe she found a very injured Sasuke. This caused her to scream and faint. Once confronted by Kakashi, Sasuke forces Kakashi to stop reading Icha Icha and use both hands to defend against his string of taijutsu attacks. Sasuke then launches a giant fireball at Kakashi. The jōnin manages to avoid it by burring underground, before dragging Sasuke down, leaving only his head to be seen.\nNaruto manages to free himself from the tree he was hanging from and spots the food for lunch. Before he can try to snag a bite, Kakashi appears and ties him to a tree post. Elsewhere, Sakura wakes up and goes to look for Sasuke, whom she still believed was injured. She finds him buried from the neck down and comes to the conclusion that he was decapitated, before fainting again. Sasuke manages to free himself and is there to see Sakura awaken, who is relieved to see he is unharmed. Despite time running out, Sasuke is still set on getting a bell, informing Sakura that he came close to doing so. Knowing that she couldn't get a bell and didn't want to be separated from Sasuke, Sakura tries to convince him to give up and try next year. Sasuke dismisses the idea, explaining that he is an avenger and doesn't need any setbacks. Before they know it, time is up.\nAfterwards, Kakashi meets with the three genin, who tells them that he won't be sending them back to the Academy. The three share in the happy news until Kakashi goes on to say that they will be dropped from being a ninja permanently. Naruto is outrage at this and asks him why. Kakashi explains that they don't think like ninja, thinking more like \"little kids\". Sasuke charges at Kakashi, but is easily restrained. Kakashi further explains that team-work was the key in retrieving a bell. Kakashi notes that each of them were so self-entitled throughout the challenge: Naruto recklessly tried to face a foe who clearly outmatched him alone, Sakura focused all her interest on Sasuke when she was prime to help Naruto, while Sasuke arrogantly believed his team-mates weren't worth his time and acted as such. After showing them Konoha's Memorial Stone, Kakashi decides to give them another chance. Kakashi tells Sasuke and Sakura to eat and replenish their energy. However, since Naruto broke the rules and tried to eat before the test was complete, he is forced to watch. Furthermore, if either of them feed Naruto, they will immediately fail.\nAfter Kakashi leaves, Sasuke and Sakura begin eating their food, while Naruto's stomach growls of hunger. Sasuke decides to share his food with Naruto, stating that they'd need to retrieve the bells as a team and need everyone at good strength. Sakura hesitates, but decides to share her food as well. Kakashi suddenly appears and tells them that they will be punished for not following orders. However, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura band together to state that they are a team, and to their surprise, are rewarded with Kakashi stating they have passed. He explains that those who break the rules are considered scum, but those who abandon their friends are even worse than scum. He states that they are the only team to abide by his orders.",

  "description": "After Team 7 successfully finds Tora, the lost cat of the Fire Daimyō's wife, they return it back to her. With their mission successfully completed, the Third Hokage informs them of the available D-rank missions, such as babysitting the chief counsellor's three-year-old. Naruto expresses that he wants to go on a real mission that's exciting and challenging. Iruka lectures him, stating that like every beginner genin with no experience, he must start with simpler missions to develop his skills. The Third goes on to explain that with a higher-ranked mission comes higher difficulty and greater risk to the shinobi. However, Naruto exclaims that he is a ninja now and wants to be treated as such. Amused at his statement, the Third decides to give the team a C-rank mission to escort Tazuna, a master bridge builder, to the Land of Waves. When Tazuna meets the team, he expresses disbelief in the fact that kids are going to be guarding him but works with them nonetheless.\nAs they make their way to the Land of Waves, two chūnin-level Kiri-nin emerge from a puddle and binds Kakashi with shuriken-laced chains, before pulling and ripping him apart. With Kakashi \"defeated\", the duo turns their attention to Naruto, who freezes up. Before they can land an attack, Sasuke intervenes and saves Naruto. The duo split up, leaving one behind as the other charges at Tazuna. Sakura steps in front of Tazuna to defend him before Sasuke appears in front of her to aid. Before anything further can happen, Kakashi appears and effortlessly defeats the duo, though Naruto does attain a small scratch from one of their Metal Gauntlets, which contained poison. It is revealed that Kakashi used the Body Replacement Technique to escape the duo's initial attack, suspecting an ambush when he discovered their puddle on a clear day. Kakashi compliments Sasuke and Sakura for their courage but expresses disappointment in Naruto with how poorly he handled the situation. Tazuna questions why Kakashi took so long to help, with the latter explaining that he could have defeated them quickly but needed to know who their target was. Kakashi points out that their target was Tazuna and that had he told them that he would be hunted by ninja, the mission would be a B-rank or higher, and a different team would have been assigned. Sakura suggests they quit the mission, not only due to the higher difficulty but because of Naruto's wound. Unwilling to jeopardise the mission, Naruto decides to take out a kunai and uses it to remove the poison from his hand. He then makes an oath that he will never run away or back down from any mission, threat, or enemy, as well as not lose to Sasuke. After this, Kakashi bandages Naruto's wound so he doesn't bleed out, but discovers that it had already begun to heal due to the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.\nElsewhere, Gatō, the man who hired the Demon Brothers to eliminate Tazuna, complains about their failure to Zabuza, the duo's apparent boss. Zabuza raises his Kubikiribōchō at Gatō to shut him up, and states that he will handle it himself. Gatō informs him that they will be expecting another assault and that a high-level ninja is accompanying Tazuna. This doesn't faze Zabuza, who just replies that he is the \"Demon of the Hidden Mist\".",

Zabuza easily catches the first shuriken but only dodges the second at the last moment. Once past Zabuza, the second shuriken transforms back into Naruto who had disguised himself to trick the superior ninja.

Naruto is angry and jealous that someone so young could easily defeat an opponent that gave Team 7 so much trouble, but Kakashi says that there are many ninja younger than Naruto yet stronger than himself. The hunter-nin leaves with Zabuza's body, and Kakashi collapses from exhaustion due to the overuse of his Sharingan.",

  "description": "While Naruto and Sasuke try to outdo each other in their Tree Climbing Practice, a worker of Tazuna's named Giichi quits, and tries to convince Tazuna to give up building the bridge. Later on their way home from a food market, Sakura is astonished by the poverty in the Land of Waves (and how many people want to steal her bag, which she initially thinks is a way to grab her butt), and Tazuna points out that their country would be much better off if the bridge were completed and Gatō removed from power. Following dinner (in which Naruto and Sasuke are constantly eating and puking in an attempt to get stronger), Sakura asks why Inari often stares at the family photo on the wall, which is torn so that a person's face and upper body are gone. Angered suddenly, Inari leaves the table, making Tsunami chase after him. Tazuna then explains that the man torn from the picture, named Kaiza, was once a hero in the Land of Waves and Inari's stepfather. A travelling fisherman, he initially met Inari after saving him from drowning, and Inari came to rely on him heavily to the point where he wouldn't stand up for himself. He became revered as a hero when he single-handedly saved a large portion of the village from a flood. However, when Gatō arrived, he had Kaiza killed in an attempt to destroy the hope of the land, a strategy that sadly succeeded and traumatised Inari. Moved by the story, Naruto decides to show Inari that there are still heroes in the world.",

  "description": "Haku is picking medicinal herbs in the forest when he encounters a sleeping Naruto, who is exhausted from training. He wakes Naruto, who loudly proclaims that he is training to become stronger (believing Haku to be a girl, and subsequently trying to impress \"her\"). Haku tells Naruto that only when a person has someone precious to protect does that person become truly strong. Naruto considers this statement and enthusiastically agrees. At Tazuna's house, Sakura and Tsunami are concerned about Naruto spending the previous night in the dark by himself, but Kakashi tells them not to worry. Sasuke abruptly leaves, saying he's going for a morning walk. Back in the forest, Haku leaves (after revealing his true gender to a shocked Naruto), and Sasuke shows up to check on Naruto and scolds him for missing breakfast. The two boys continue their Tree Climbing Practice into the evening, until they finally make it to the top of their respective trees.\nNaruto and Sasuke return triumphantly to Tazuna's home, with Naruto cheerful, yet completely drained from the effort. Inari is disturbed at the sight of Naruto, who has exhausted himself for what Inari thinks is a futile struggle against Gatō and his men. He thinks of Kaiza and tearfully tells Naruto that he only thinks he can win because he has not suffered as Inari has. Naruto tells Inari that he is a coward and leaves the table. Later that night, Kakashi tells a despondent Inari that Naruto didn't mean to hurt him. Kakashi continues to explain that Naruto is an orphan who has suffered more than Inari knows and understands Inari's pain better than anyone.\nThe next day, Team 7 escort Tazuna to the bridge, but leave Naruto sleeping to recover from his excessive use of chakra. Once at the work site, the team is confronted by Zabuza, who has returned for round 2.",

  "description": "Naruto's chakra rages around him wildly. Haku remarks that chakra usually couldn't be seen, yet it was clearly visible. Naruto, still angered by the \"death\" of Sasuke, had weakened the seal that kept the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's chakra in place. Surging with power, Naruto healed his wounds and attacked, brutally overwhelming Haku, and deflecting his needle attacks with waves of pure chakra. Haku attempts to flee the circle, but Naruto sees him and snatches his arm with the speed of the Nine-Tails.\nMeanwhile, the battle between Zabuza and Kakashi continued. Kakashi was relieved to sense that the seal for the Nine-Tails had only weakened, and had only let a small portion of the fox's chakra out. He decided to end the battle quickly. Zabuza was curious as to how Kakashi would do that when he couldn't find Zabuza. Kakashi's only response to this was to pull out a scroll.\nNaruto, having grabbed Haku's arm, delivered a powerful punch, sending Haku through one of the mirrors and, through that process, destroying them all. Naruto rushed at Haku again, ready to deliver another enormous punch, but, at that moment, Haku's mask came off, to reveal the boy he had met in the forest. This caused Naruto to pause in his attack. Haku asked Naruto to kill him, because he was no longer useful to Zabuza, calling himself nothing more than a broken tool. Haku then went on to explain his past; about how he was born in a small village, and how his parents dearly loved him. However, during that time, anyone with a kekkei genkai, a bloodline trait, was feared. When Haku was a small boy, he discovered that he had inherited one from his mother. Unfortunately, his father discovered this, and killed Haku's mother. Just as Haku's father was about to kill him too, Haku tapped into his unknown powers and killed his father. A little while after that day, Zabuza found Haku, and took him with him to train him in the most advanced ninja skills.\nKakashi finally used the scroll he had pulled out earlier to use the Summoning: Earth Release: Tracking Fang Technique on Zabuza in order to track him. Kakashi revealed that, even though he could not see or hear Zabuza, he would be able to follow his scent. He also revealed that, earlier, he had let Zabuza cut him so that Zabuza would be covered in his blood, and therefore easier to track. Kakashi then said he would introduce Zabuza to his one and only original technique: the Lightning Cutter.",

  "description": "Inari runs door to door throughout the Land of Waves trying to rally the villagers to defend Tazuna and the bridge. To his disappointment, the adults are too afraid to get involved, but Inari is willing to go to the bridge alone if necessary. At the bridge, Kakashi has immobilised Zabuza with his Ninken and readies his Lightning Cutter for a finishing blow. Meanwhile, Haku, having been defeated by Naruto, has seemingly lost his purpose in life (serving Zabuza) and requests that Naruto kill him. Naruto is confused and argues that being a shinobi is more than just mindless killing, but Haku won't be dissuaded. Naruto relents, saying softly that they might have been friends under different circumstances, and charges at Haku with his kunai drawn. However, Haku senses that Zabuza's life is in danger and blocks Naruto's attack. Declaring he's not ready to die yet, he rushes to Zabuza's side just in time to take all the damage of Kakashi's Lightning Cutter. Back at the village, Tsunami tells Inari that he is too young to fight, but he is determined to defend his village. His demeanour reminds Tsunami of Kaiza, which surprises her. Inari leaves to go protect the bridge but finds a crowd waiting for him outside. As Zabuza's mist clears, Naruto is stunned to find Haku killed by Kakashi's attack. Zabuza is unfazed by his partner's sacrifice and swings his sword to slice through Kakashi and Haku at the same time. Kakashi evades this blow and prepares to resume the fight, telling an enraged Naruto to stay out of it. Tazuna accompanies Sakura to Sasuke's body. The girl tries to maintain her composure as per shinobi requirements but breaks down in tears when she sees that Sasuke is cold and lifeless. Kakashi once again immobilises Zabuza, this time disabling both of his arms. With Zabuza unable to swing his sword or perform techniques, the battle seems over. Gatō appears with dozens of hired thugs and tells Zabuza that he's fired.",

Gatō kicks Haku's dead body, which infuriates Naruto, but Zabuza is unfazed, saying he only used Haku as weapon just as Gatō used him. Naruto cannot accept this and begins to cry, saying that Zabuza is precious to Haku and gave everything so that Zabuza could accomplish his goals. Moved by Naruto's tears and words, Zabuza reveals that he is crying as well and acknowledges Haku's sacrifice. Without the use of his arms that have been immobilised by Kakashi, Zabuza borrows Naruto's kunai, taking it in his teeth, and he charges at Gatō. Zabuza is stabbed multiple times by Gatō's thugs but still manages to kill the mob boss despite severe injuries. Meanwhile, the rest of Team 7 are relieved to discover that Sasuke is still alive, having been purposely spared any lethal injuries by Haku. Gatō's men are scared away by the villagers of the Land of Waves who arrive to defend Tazuna and their village. Afterwards, a wounded Zabuza requests that Kakashi place him beside Haku. Before dying, Zabuza says that he wants to go to the same place as Haku, and Kakashi says that he believes they'll go to the same place together, seeing Zabuza's change of heart on the end. Team 7 bury the two ninja in a peaceful place, leaving Zabuza's sword, Kubikiribōchō, as a marker for his grave. Naruto is unsatisfied with the prevailing notion that ninjas should strive to become merely tools, and he declares that he will find his own ninja way. He says goodbye to Inari, and the team returns to Konohagakure. After their succeeded mission, Tazuna decides to name the finished bridge the Great Naruto Bridge.",

  "description": "After completing their mission in the Land of Waves, Team 7 returns to Konohagakure. Although Sasuke saved Naruto's life their teamwork seems to have got even worse than before with Naruto intent on beating Sasuke causing him to mess up on subsequent missions. Kakashi decides that their teamwork is too off that day and sends them all home. Before leaving Sasuke tells Naruto in a matter-of-fact manner to simply get stronger than him before telling Sakura who had suggested that the two work of their own teamwork skills, that she was worse than Naruto. Konohamaru and his two friends: Udon and Moegi would later stalk Naruto. As antics ensue, Konohamaru accidentally bumps into a foreign ninja who he then insults causing the latter to threaten to kill him. Naruto attempts to attack the newcomer but is tripped by his invisible attack. Just as the mysterious ninja is about to hit Konohamaru, Sasuke saves the day by forcing the ninja to drop Konohamaru. Just as the mysterious ninja is about to attack Sasuke, another one, appears telling the latter to stop playing around. Meanwhile, all the jōnin are gathered along with the Third Hokage. He announces that the chūnin exams will take place in seven days on July 1.",

  "description": "As the Three Sand Siblings are introduced, Gaara scolds Kankurō for his abuse of the kids. Gaara then apologises to Sasuke for Kankurō's behaviour. The three are ninja from Sunagakure and they come here in Konoha for the Chūnin Exams. Another team watches unseen from a tree nearby. The Third Hokage asks Kakashi, Asuma and Kurenai to step forward and recommend any Genin they believe to be fit to take the Chūnin Exams. Iruka thinks that the rookies need more time, and that there is no way that any of them will be recommended. However, all three jōnin recommend their students which shocks Iruka greatly. Iruka challenges their decision, as he believes Naruto and the others are not ready for the exam. They however stand by their decision and the Hokage agrees, but only after Kakashi reminds Iruka they are no longer his students, but ninja under his command. The next morning Kakashi gives Team 7 the application forms for the Chūnin Exams. Both Sasuke and Naruto accept, but Sakura is uncertain. Later, all three of Team 7 are attacked by a mysterious ninja from a different village. Moegi is captured by a mysterious ninja, and is seen tied up and gagged with a cloth. Naruto eventually saves her, but the mysterious ninja escapes. Sakura is taken in by his genjutsu but quickly figures it out. Despite this she is still uncertain about the exam. Sasuke easily defeats the ninja, telling him to stay out of Konohagakure. The ninja is revealed to be Iruka in disguise. He reports back to Kakashi, confirming they all passed his test. Inside the school registration for the exam is taking place, but two shinobi bar the way warning all the genin about the exam. An altercation nearly takes place but Rock Lee steps in and diffuses the situation, which surprises Sasuke. Rock Lee later goes after Sasuke and challenges him to a duel.",

  "description": "Sasuke has attracted the attention of Rock Lee, who challenges him to a fight. Lee is not only interested in seeing how his skills match up against a descendant of the Uchiha clan, but he also has a crush on Sakura, much to her dismay. Feeling neglected in his teammates' shadows, Naruto offers to fight in Sasuke's place. Without wasting time, he charges, but is easily knocked out by Lee. Lee explains that they cannot beat him because he is the strongest of the Konohagakure genin right now. Now interested, Sasuke accepts his challenge. Sasuke attacks and is met by Lee's Leaf Whirlwind and gets knocked backwards. As he gets back up, he prepares to use his Sharingan to figure out Lee's technique. He again charges Lee, but again, Lee is able to hit him. Lee explains that his moves are neither ninjutsu or genjutsu, but mere taijutsu, also known as martial arts. With hand-to-hand fighting, Sasuke's Sharingan isn't helpful because even if he can see the techniques, his body cannot move fast enough to react. Lee uses the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf to kick off his next attack in order to finish off Sasuke, but a large turtle stops his attack before it hits.\nThe turtle seemingly reprimands Lee for using his forbidden technique, leaving Naruto to think the turtle is Lee's sensei. Might Guy (Lee's actual sensei) appears on top of the turtle and punches Lee hard in the face as punishment. Guy proceeds to hug Lee, and the two cry. Team 7 are dumbstruck, and Sasuke can't believe he was beaten by what he perceives as a freak. Guy asks the team how his eternal rival, Kakashi, is doing. He's ahead in the match record, which stands at 50 wins and 49 losses. Guy also says that he is much faster and stronger than Kakashi.\nWhen Guy leaves, Lee confesses that he is not the strongest genin - Neji Hyūga, Lee's teammate is. Naruto needles Sasuke, saying that Lee obviously trains harder than Sasuke. In the end, the team focuses their attention on the Chūnin Exams.",

  "description": "Kakashi meets up with Team 7 before they enter the hall of the Chūnin Exams. He informs them that unless they had all consented to take the exams, none of them would have been permitted to enter. With that, he wishes them good luck. Within the hall, the Rookie Nine meet up and have a spirited discussion. Kabuto Yakushi warns them to quiet down as they are seemingly irritating the shinobi around them. Explaining the exams further, Kabuto uses his Ninja Info Cards to give Sasuke information on Gaara and Rock Lee. Kabuto says that the individuals taking the exams are all most likely elites from their respective villages, a fact that intimidates the rookies. With his standard enthusiasm, Naruto loudly proclaims that he won't lose to anyone, and the rest of the room reacts to his words with equal parts shock and annoyance. Insulted by Kabuto's earlier detailing of the villages in which he discarded Otogakure as a minor village, three Oto-nin attack Kabuto. Although it appears that Kabuto dodged the attack, his glasses suddenly break and he becomes nauseated despite not being hit. Before things can escalate any further, the proctor, Ibiki Morino, and his team appear on the scene. With that, the Chūnin Exams begin.",

  "description": "Forty-five minutes into the written portion of the Chūnin Exams, Ibiki Morino announces that it is time for the tenth and final question. But, he ominously states that there is one special rule for this question. Meanwhile, Kakashi Hatake, Asuma Sarutobi, and Kurenai Yūhi rest at the Academy staff room and discuss their respective teams' chances of passing the first phase. Kakashi and Asuma explain to Kurenai that Ibiki specialises in interrogation and knows how to get inside the minds of his victims. Back at the exam, Ibiki states that the candidates are free to choose whether or not they want to try and solve the tenth question. If they opt out, the entire team will fail. If they choose to answer the question but get it wrong, they will be barred from taking the Chūnin Exams forever. Several teams decide to leave rather than risk it. Naruto doesn't have any answers to the first nine questions and knows that the odds of him knowing the answer to the tenth are exceedingly small. He seems to waver but finally exclaims in his loud style that he will not be intimidated and will become Hokage even if he fails and remains a genin forever. This outburst calms the remaining teams, and everyone is determined to stay for the remaining question. Seeing that no one else is going to leave, Ibiki passes them all. He explains that the first nine questions were to test their information gathering skills, whereas the tenth was to test their determination and bravery. The first phase of the exam completed, Anko Mitarashi spectacularly crashes through the window and states she is the second examiner. After the students leave, Ibiki picks up Naruto's exam paper and smiles to himself, realising he just passed a student who didn't answer a single question. The next day the candidates gather outside the Forest of Death.",

  "description": "While hiding under a tree, Sakura tends to Sasuke and Naruto's wounds, even though severely sleep-deprived. Alerted from a daze by a squirrel, Sakura quickly wards it off with a kunai, ignorant to the fact that Team Dosu had sent the squirrel there with an explosive tag on its back. While en route to find a second scroll, Rock Lee stops on a branch, and sets himself the task of catching all the leaves that had fallen, believing that if he did, Sakura would fall in love with him. After catching 19 of the 20 leaves, he spots a squirrel with an explosive tag on its back, and saves it before destroying the explosive tag. Dosu and his squad challenge Sasuke, but Sakura, prepared to defend her comrades, sets off several traps at the enemy shinobi. Unfortunately, Dosu manages to destroy the trap with ease, and shortly after that makes a remark about how Sakura has no right to be a ninja. Just before they could land their attack, however, Rock Lee shows up and knocks the three of them away. Declaring as he made his entrance that he would protect Sakura until he died, Lee uses his brute strength to pull up an underground root to block an incoming attack by Dosu. As the battle ensued, Lee prepared to use the Front Lotus after deeming that it met the criteria that his teacher, Might Guy, told him had to be met in order to use it (to protect the people most precious to him). Lee is then able to catch Dosu and use the technique, but the force of impact is cushioned by Zaku, and Dosu is saved. Unable to move as his body is recuperating from the strain of using the Front Lotus, Dosu incapacitates Lee with his own technique, which he claims is faster than Lee's taijutsu since it works at the speed of sound.",

Sasuke orders Naruto to take a break, as he had used a lot of chakra and should be unable to move; however, Naruto rushes forward and punches all three of the Ame genin, surprising Sasuke, Kabuto and Sakura, with Kabuto realising that Naruto's chakra levels must be exceedingly high to still be able to fight after pulling off a Multiple Shadow Clone Technique along with a Transformation Technique. After a brief struggle, Naruto knocks out the enemies and takes their scroll, at which point they head to the tower and meet with Kabuto's team. Unknown to Naruto and his friends, Kabuto is revealed to be a spy from Otogakure, and submits all of the data he gathered on them to his master, Orochimaru.",

  "description": "Tenten and Temari are chosen to fight next. Tenten makes the first move and Temari easily dodges it. Team Guy was surprised that no weapon could even scratch or hit Temari. Tenten tries another attack that Temari repels using wind from her Giant Folding Fan, before warning Tenten that if she sees all three stars (moons in the English anime) in her fan, the fight will be over. Tenten uses her Twin Rising Dragons technique. Uncovering the second star, Temari repels the attack, then Tenten uses strings to re-use the weapons. Uncovering the third star, Temari repels the attack and traps Tenten in a cyclone. When Tenten falls from the cyclone, Temari makes her land on her fan, knocking her out. After being declared winner, Temari tries to throw Tenten on the many weapons scattered on the floor, but Rock Lee descends and catches her. He then attacks Temari, only to be stopped by Might Guy, who warns the Suna shinobi to not underestimate Lee.\nShikamaru and Kin Tsuchi are then next. Shikamaru tries the Shadow Imitation Technique but Kin easily evades and throws some senbon with bells attached at him. Shikamaru recognises the trick and mocks her for using such basic techniques. Kin then rings the bells on the senbon, starting her genjutsu. Shikamaru gets caught in Kin's Bell Ring Genjutsu, unable to move, while Kin proceeds to attack him with more senbon. Hovewer, when Kin tries to attack again, she suddenly realises that she can't move. Shikamaru tells her that he extended his Shadow Imitation Technique through the shadow of the wires she's holding. He then throws a shuriken at Kin, which she imitates. When Shikamaru ducks backwards to evade it, Kin is forced to imitate him, but she did not realise that she was too close to the wall, hitting her head and knocking herself out.\nShikamaru is declared the winner of the match and Naruto and Kiba are chosen to fight next.",

He tells Naruto that someone better than he will train him. Ebisu arrives and announces himself as Naruto's new trainer. Naruto complains why a man weaker than himself has to train him. Naruto almost tells Kakashi of when he defeated Ebisu using his Harem Technique but Ebisu covers his mouth, persuading him not to tell anybody (bribing him with free ramen).\nAfter Kakashi leaves, Ebisu challenges Naruto to run away from him, and promises his resignation as Naruto's tutor if he escapes, adding that he would be able to take over some of Kakashi's duties, thus leaving Kakashi time to train Naruto himself. Naruto hastily agrees and proceeds to attempt to hide, to no avail as he is easily found by Ebisu. Naruto resorts to using his transformation technique to imitate a girl on a billboard sign but is again discovered by Ebisu. As a last resort he creates many shadow clones and they all run away in different directions. Ebisu, however, performs his own shadow clone technique and easily dispatches the clones and finds the real Naruto.\nAfter that, they eat together at the Ramen Ichiraku. He then explains his usage of chakra, and how Naruto uses much more chakra than necessary. Naruto counters that he's still able to pull off feats that Sasuke and Sakura can do, which Ebisu attests to the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra being accessible to Naruto. After eating, they head to the Hot Spring Town. Ebisu tells Naruto that they will train here. He then explains about the water walking practice. Excited, Naruto attempts it, but falls into the water. He tries repeatedly but to no avail as he continuously falls into the water. As Naruto quickly begins to grasp the basics of the technique, Ebisu realises that he misunderstood him, and even thinks that he is an excellent Konoha ninja.\nEbisu then sees a white-haired man peeking into the women's changeroom and attacks him; but the white haired man summons a frog and easily defeats him, with Naruto witnessing the attack.",

Though the man refuses and leaves, Naruto is impressed by his skill and pursues him. Naruto catches up with the sage as he is being rejected by a woman, but he traps the boy in a jar and escapes once more. Naruto finds the sage again as he is daydreaming outside of town, and after his Transformation Technique fails to fool Naruto, he tells the boy that he will train him in exchange for bringing him curvy \"fruit\". Having misunderstood the innuendo, Naruto later approaches the sage with a watermelon as he is attempting to impress two women. The man explains that he actually desires an attractive woman and Naruto responds by using his Sexy Technique. Thoroughly impressed, he says he will train Naruto provided he remains in that form, but then admits he was kidding when the boy protests.\nUnder the sage's supervision, Naruto resumes his training, but fails to stand on the hot spring water and removes his wet clothing in frustration. Recognising Naruto's seal as the work of the Fourth Hokage, the Toad Sage secretly removes the Five Elements Seal preventing Naruto from efficiently controlling his chakra. With this impediment removed, Naruto happily walks across the water without trouble. The sage decides that it is time to teach Naruto to control the Nine-Tails' chakra, but insists they stop training for the day and head to the hot springs for a bath. Later that night, as Naruto sleeps, Ebisu approaches the Toad Sage and identifies him as Jiraiya of the Sannin, one of the few who can stop Orochimaru.",

Jiraiya finally tells Naruto that he's teaching him the Summoning Technique. Listening to Naruto describe his chakra, Jiraiya tells him that he must use his \"red chakra\" to use the technique so he had to first use up all of his regular chakra. So Naruto depleted his chakra using the Shadow Clone Technique. After that, Jiraiya summoned a frog, with a summoning contract scroll. After signing the contract, Naruto tried using the Summoning Technique, but only a tadpole appeared. Hayate's body was later found by a group of Anbu with Yūgao Uzuki wondering aloud what had happened.",

Sakura sits in her bedroom, still worried about Sasuke. Meanwhile, the Third Hokage has a meeting with the jōnin regarding Hayate Gekkō's body found near Kikyō Castle. They discuss Orochimaru's involvement, although the Hokage concludes that they do not have any information regarding to the latter. He also expresses his trust to the shinobi that if Otogakure and Sunagakure invade Konohagakure, they would assemble and fight.\nSakura goes to Yamanaka Flowers to buy flowers for Sasuke, where Ino is in charge of running the shop. After deducing that Sakura is there to buy flowers for Sasuke, Ino decides to visit him as well. Ino picks a rose and Sakura picks two daffodils; one for Sasuke and the other for Rock Lee. On their way, they hear Chōji eating loudly. Peeking through an open window, they spot Asuma Sarutobi and Shikamaru, who are seated with Choji. In exchange for training with Shikamaru everyday, Asuma has been treating Choji to barbeque. In the woods, Neji is shown training with Tenten. During his training, Neji collapses after having used too much chakra. Team Kurenai trains in the woods too, to prepare for Shino's match. Elsewhere, The Three Sand Siblings and Baki secretly discuss their invasion plans.\nMeanwhile, Naruto continues to practise his Summoning Technique while Jiraiya peeks at the bikini-clad women. At the hospital, the nurse permits Ino and Sakura only five minutes of visitation due of Sasuke's condition; however, Sasuke and his clothes are missing. Kakashi is undergoing the Cliff Climbing Practice, and after nearly falling to his death, activates the First Gate. Kakashi uses his increased strength to make it to the top of the rock, only to see Sasuke waiting there for him. Back at the hospital, Lee is also missing from his bed. Sakura spots Lee outside, performing his push-ups. Sakura recalls Ino telling her that Lee's injuries were severe to the point that he would never be a shinobi again. After completing 199 out of 200 push-ups, Lee collapses. Lee later wakes up in his hospital bed and notices a daffodil, realising that someone had come to visit him earlier.\nBack at the waterfall, Jiraiya stops peeking once he realises the girls are gone and are not coming back. He tells Naruto to call it a day, but Naruto protests, using his Sexy Technique to convince Jiraiya to continue training him. On his last attempt, Naruto once again summons a tadpole, much to Jiraiya's irritation. However, Naruto claims that he is improving, as this tadpole possesses legs.",

Elsewhere, the Third Hokage speaks with Anko, telling her that there is no one in Konohagakure who can stand against Orochimaru. Anko mentions the Fourth Hokage, but the Third replies that he is dead and they must do it with their own strength. Jiraiya wakes Naruto and spends the day with him, bathing together in a hot spring and later eating at Ramen Ichiraku. Jiraiya tells Naruto to eat as if it were his last meal, and leaves before Naruto can thank him for the food, forcing Naruto to pay for it. When Naruto finds him, Jiraiya tells the boy to hug his crush, after which Naruto attempts to hug Sakura and is beaten up in return. Continuing their training, Jiraiya renders Naruto unconscious and throws him off a high cliff as he awakens, attempting to force the boy to draw on the Nine-Tails' power.\nBeneath the Hokage Rock, Iruka teaches his class about the history of the Hokage. The Third watches the class and Iruka invites him in, telling the children that the Third was said to be the strongest Hokage and a genius renowned as The Professor. The Third tells the students to protect their loved ones, and when they ask him who his own loved ones are, he replies his grandson, Konohamaru, and all the people of the village. Meanwhile, Naruto enters his subconscious and speaks with the Nine-Tails for the first time. The fox lends Naruto some of his chakra to prevent them both from dying, and with it, Naruto successfully summons a gigantic toad.",

In order for Gamabunta to accept Naruto as his underling, he told Naruto that he must stay on his back the whole day without falling off. Meanwhile in Konoha, Temari argues with Baki over breaking the treaty alliance between Konoha and Sunagakure. Later in Suna, Baki reports to the Fourth Kazekage that everything was going according to plan. Gamabunta still tries to shake Naruto off as Jiraiya is doing \"research\" for his novel by spying on a group of girls. In an attempt to shake Naruto off, Gamabunta lands in a waterfall, scaring off the girls, much to Jiraiya's dismay. This then caused Naruto to fall off the toad's back, but in an effort to stay on the toad's back, he makes a chain of shadow clones to not let Naruto fall off. Tired out, Naruto finally falls off the Chief Toad's back. As a reward for lasting so long, Gamabunta catches Naruto with his tongue and claimed that no one since the Fourth Hokage had stayed on his back for so long. Knowing that Naruto is depleted of his strength, Gamabunta drops off Naruto at the Konoha Hospital.",

Shikamaru gives Naruto a fruit basket originally intended for Chōji, who has been hospitalised for indigestion, having eaten too much. Sakura goes to Lee's room and replaces the flower.

Incapacitated by Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique, Gaara divulges a little bit about his past, revealing that he has a sand demon named Shukaku sealed within him from birth. Naruto sympathises, as he also has a demon within him. Gaara attempts to kill the two of them, but Guy steps in and demands Gaara to leave at once. Gaara has no choice but to do so, but before doing it, he promises that he'll kill them all.",

He eats at the Ramen Ichiraku, where Teuchi and Ayame gave him a big bowl of ramen on the house, since his match will be tomorrow. The previous Ino–Shika–Chō eat at a restaurant, with Inoichi being teased about the fact that he has a daughter. Chōza places an additional order, and then Shikamaru appears, telling his father they need to go home. Temari and Kankurō are preparing their weapons, while Gaara is sitting on the rooftop. Neji and Tenten are shown to be practising, as well as Shino. The next day, Naruto meets Hinata where Team 7 had their bell test. Hinata concludes that he may defeat Neji, adding that Naruto's words of encouragement during her match with Neji made her a better person. This prompts Naruto to say that he likes people like Hinata and invites her to watch his fight against Neji. Hearing fireworks, he rushes to the stadium so he could make it in time. On his way, he sees Konohamaru who tells Naruto that he knows the shortcut to the stadium, but Konohamaru just brings him to the other side of the village. He then tells Naruto to ride the daimyō's bulls to the stadium; Naruto kicks the bull, causing a stampede. Despite the trouble, Naruto finally arrives to the stadium, just in time for his match.",

Naruto's clones fails to hit Neji, and Neji aims for what he believes is the real Naruto, but is unsuccessful. Then Naruto uses more clones of himself to attack Neji, only to fail when Neji uses the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven. Hiashi and Hinata are shocked to see it, since it is a move taught only to the main branch of the Hyūga clan. Naruto makes seven more clones, which encircle Neji, and charges at him again, only to be repelled once more by Neji's revolving technique. Neji then takes the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms stance, which surprises Hiashi (since this technique is an elite move exclusive only to the strongest of the Hyūga main branch) and proceeds to strike all of Naruto's sixty-four chakra points. Genma then walks up to the two to determine whether the match is over or not. Kiba then asks Hinata if she is okay, since Hinata is coughing up blood. Neji is surprised that Naruto is still conscious following the attack. Naruto feels dizzy but remembers when Lee and Hinata had critical injuries due to their matches, but still managed to stand up and continue giving it their all. Naruto manages to get back on his feet, shocking Neji. Naruto then asks about the Hyūga clan and Neji's hatred for it. Neji takes off his forehead protector and reveals the Hyūga Main Family's Juinjutsu. Neji then explains about the cursed seal and the circumstances surrounding his father's death and the Hyūga clan's branch family and says that Naruto's fate in their match was already decided when Naruto was chosen as his opponent.",

Asuma, Kurenai Yūhi, and the Third Hokage are all surprised to see that Naruto was able to control the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's chakra on command. After some medical-nin take Neji into a room to treat his injuries, Hiashi Hyūga comes in the room, asking for some time alone. Hiashi then hands him a scroll, and Neji realises it is in his father's handwriting. The scroll then described the truth that took place during the Hyūga Affair many years ago. Despite the elders wanting Hizashi to die in Hiashi's place in order to seal away the Byakugan, Hizashi stated that he wanted to die of his own free will, not to protect the Head Family, but to protect his brother and their village. Hiashi then bowed his head to Neji, begging for his forgiveness. Neji then asked his uncle to raise his head, and proclaimed his goal was to become stronger. After many complaints that Sasuke was late against his match with Gaara, the Third Hokage decides to disqualify Sasuke. However, \"The Fourth Kazekage\" tells the Third Hokage that many of the other village's leaders and daimyō have come to Konoha for the sole purpose of watching the sole surviving Uchiha face off against Suna's very own Gaara; hearing this, the Third Hokage decides to postpone Sasuke's match. Kankurō's match is thus moved up, but he forfeits his match with Shino Aburame, not wanting to reveal Karasu's inner workings to Konoha, thus allowing Shino to win by default. With Kankurō's withdrawal, the next match is set to begin, between Temari and Shikamaru Nara.",

Realising that the ninth one purposely stayed behind the others in order to prevent a complete ambush, and that his chakra is still limited from his fight with Temari, Shikamaru contemplates on his life and seems to accept his upcoming death. However, Asuma arrives to defeat all the enemies without even breaking a sweat, saving Shikamaru. Temari, Kankurō, and Gaara are in the forest as well, with Temari noticing that there are more people pursuing them.

  "description": "As Gaara continues to reminisce about Yashamaru, he remembers Yashamaru's defeat and attempted suicide bombing. Yashamaru tells him that Gaara's father, The Fourth Kazekage, ordered him to kill Gaara. He also adds that while he could have refused the order, he wanted to kill Gaara because he hated Gaara for causing his sister's death. Yashamaru then opens his flak jacket and reveals explosive tags on his torso, which detonates. Although he was able to survive the blast, Gaara lost the only person who he thought ever cared for him, who revealed that he never did love him at all. From that point on, Gaara came to love and care about only himself, and starting living off of killing others, believing that to be the purpose of his existence.\nReturning to the present day, Gaara quickly restrains Sakura with a claw made of sand and slowly squeezes her. He detaches the arm holding Sakura and regenerates it, and continues to transform further into Shukaku. Now having no more humanoid features, Gaara resolves to kill Naruto as well, all the while telling Naruto that he must fight for himself and not for his friends. Determined to save Sasuke and Sakura at all costs, Naruto attempts to summon Gamabunta, but ends up summoning Gamakichi, a smaller toad who is unable to fight. Gaara then launches Sand Shuriken at them; Naruto manages to save Gamakichi as the shuriken pummels him. Naruto realises that Gaara is lonely, just like how he used to be before he met Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi and Iruka, and wonders if he would have ended up like Gaara had he not met them. Thinking back on how meeting his friends gave him happiness and saved him from darkness, Naruto resolves to save them from Gaara, even at the cost of his own life.",

  "description": "Naruto attacks Gaara using his shadow clones and performs the One Thousand Years of Death with a kunai and explosive tag, damaging Gaara's form. Sasuke tells Naruto to save Sakura, and that he would hold Gaara off long enough for them to escape. Realising that Gaara is just like him and remembering his conversation with Haku, Naruto produces nine hundred and ninety-nine shadow clones, which all attack Gaara at once. Gaara responds by fully transforming and attempting to crush Naruto, but he escapes by summoning Gamabunta. The toad identifies Gaara's form as Shukaku of the Sand, and agrees to fight alongside Naruto after learning that he protected his son, quickly severing Shukaku's right arm. Emerging from Shukaku's head, Gaara uses the Feigning Sleep Technique and falls asleep, handing over control to Shukaku and drastically increasing its power. Realising they stand no chance unless they wake Gaara up, Gamabunta tries to grab hold of Shukaku. After the initial attempt fails, Gamabunta tells Naruto to use the Combination Transformation to transform them into something that has fangs and claws. Charging toward Shukaku, Naruto manages to transform them just in time, becoming the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.",

At the site of the Third Hokage's battle with Orochimaru, the Third realises that he doesn't have enough strength left to fully seal Orochimaru's soul, and instead opted to seal his former pupil's arms successfully to make Orochimaru unable to use any ninjutsu. Wishing his student a fond farewell, the Third dies after reciting one last proverb. At this time Naruto and Gaara leap at each other, and Naruto succeeds in delivering the winning blow.",

Sasuke is seen thinking about the night of his parents' death and his inability to stop it — and throws a kunai at the place where he perceived his memory. Naruto completes his morning training and meets up with Konohamaru, who is gazing at the mountainside image of the Third. Konohamaru impresses Naruto with his commitment to rebuilding the village, and Naruto hands him a coupon for free ramen at Ichiraku. Somewhere in Sunagakure, the rotten corpses of the Fourth Kazekage and his two guards are discovered by a shinobi team led by Baki, who curses Orochimaru for his deception, while the latter is shown recovering in his hideout alongside Kabuto while discussing the difficulty of his situation and his future goals. Jiraiya is approached by the village's elders, who offer him the position of Fifth Hokage, as he is one of the legendary Sannin.

Within the tea shop are the two hooded figures, which the three jōnin realise but don't convey; with a nod by Kakashi, the two jōnin head to meet up with the duo, while Sasuke is whisked away by Kakashi. Asuma and Kurenai demand to know the identities of the duo, and are surprised to see the infamous Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshikagi in their village. The four engage in battle, though Itachi and Kisame quickly gain the advantage. As Asuma and Kurenai are about to be killed, Kakashi comes to their rescue.",

Itachi, however, is more so, having access to the Mangekyō Sharingan, and quickly attacks Kakashi with his Tsukuyomi. With his genjutsu, Itachi tortures Kakashi for what he perceives as seventy-two hours in seconds. As Kakashi struggles to remain standing, he asks Itachi why he has returned to Konoha. Itachi replies that they're after Naruto. Kakashi remembers a conversation with Jiraiya, where Jiraiya tells him that he has been monitoring Orochimaru's activities ever since he left the village, and adds that at one point, Orochimaru joined a rogue organisation known as the Akatsuki, an organisation Itachi is a part of. Jiraiya also tells Kakashi that due to Naruto possessing the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox inside him, he will have to live the rest of his life watching his back, and therefore he will be taking over Naruto's training. Kakashi elaborates Itachi's words as meaning they want the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox for the Akatsuki. Angered that Kakashi knows of their organisation, Itachi instructs Kisame to kill Asuma and Kurenai, but to bring Kakashi with them. Before Kisame can do so, Might Guy arrives, forcing the two with no choice but to flee.\nMeanwhile, Sasuke returns to the Uchiha Clan's basement and is angered as he remembers his clan's massacre. Jiraiya attempts to bring Naruto with him on his search for Tsunade; Naruto initially refuses, as he wishes to stay in Konoha so Kakashi can teach him the Chidori. Jiraiya tells Naruto that he's prepared to teach Naruto a jutsu that is stronger than Chidori, and this convinces Naruto to tag along with Jiraiya.",

She then remembers when Naruto attempted to convince Kakashi to teach him the Chidori, following the end of the Konoha Crush. She had thanked Sasuke for saving her from Gaara, but he tells her that it was Naruto who saved her. Although Sakura initially believes that Sasuke is being modest, Sasuke adamantly states that it was Naruto, who showed newfound strength, who had saved her. Remembering this, Sakura decides to bring Naruto some dumplings as well.\nNaruto and Jiraiya are on their way to another town, as Naruto begins to wonder what kind of technique Jiraiya will teach him next. Naruto wonders why Jiraiya chose him to be his pupil, and Jiraiya mentions that Naruto reminds him of the Fourth Hokage, who he reveals was his student. Naruto is surprised, and asks who trained Jiraiya, to which Jiraiya states that his sensei was none other than the Third Hokage. Jiraiya asks whether Kakashi had done the bell test with Naruto, and Naruto admits that he was tied to a stump. Jiraiya laughs as he fondly remembers the same bell test being administered to him; while Orochimaru and Tsunade got the bells, Jiraiya was tied to a stump as well. Unbeknownst to Naruto or Jiraiya, they are being followed by Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki, both of whom decide not to engage in a fight against a legendary Sannin.\nBack in Konoha, Sasuke is training by himself in the woods, attempting to destroy rocks using his Chidori. He remembers Naruto's fight against Gaara, and muses how Naruto is getting stronger everyday. Wanting to be stronger as well, he goes off to find Kakashi. Following their fight, Guy, Asuma, and Kurenai take an unconscious Kakashi home to rest, where they decided that Sasuke should not know of Itachi's return. They stop discussing Itachi when Guy notices someone outside; Sasuke enters the room looking for Kakashi, only to be shocked that Kakashi is bedridden and that there are three jonin the in room. Aoba then barges in and loudly asks whether it's true that Itachi has returned and is after Naruto. Determined to protect Naruto from Itachi as well as kill Itachi for murdering the Uchiha clan, Sasuke rushes out to find Naruto, only to discover that Naruto had already left the village with Jiraiya.\nIn another town, Naruto sits in a hotel room training by himself while Jiraiya is out on a date with Emi, an attractive woman he had just met. Sasuke arrives in the town as well, visiting every single inn and hotel asking if a blond kid his age and an old man with white hair reside there. One such innkeeper tells Sasuke that there is such people in a room down the hall; Sasuke rushes down and knocks on the door. In his room, Naruto hears knocking on the door and believes it is Jiraiya. Sasuke's door opens to reveal another blond haired boy with an old white haired man, while Naruto opens his door to face none other than Itachi himself.",

  "description": "As Naruto opens the door and finds himself face to face with Itachi, he realises that he looks just like Sasuke and has the Sharingan eyes as well. Meanwhile, Sasuke is running through the streets, desperate to find Itachi. While running, he reminisces on his past. When he was younger, Sasuke had always looked up to his brother. One morning, he had asked Itachi to help him with his shuriken training, only for Itachi to brush him off. Sasuke then asked his father how come Itachi never had time for him. His father told Sasuke that Itachi was very closed off and distant, and that not even he knew his own son very well. Sasuke's mother then gave Sasuke his lunch, and Sasuke headed off to the Academy. On the way there, he came across a relative of his, who mentioned that by his age, Itachi had already awakened his Sharingan and had become a genin. Sasuke was initially put down, but his uncle Teyaki assured him that in time, he would be a great shinobi as well, for he was an Uchiha like his brother. After school, Sasuke rushed home, fearing he was late as the sun had already set. Sasuke then noticed the bodies of his relatives littered across the streets, with blood, shuriken and kunai on the walls and doors. Fearful, Sasuke rushed home, only to find his parents dead. Realising it was Itachi who was responsible, Sasuke demanded to know why he had slaughtered their entire clan. Itachi claimed that he had murdered everyone to test his strength. Sasuke ran outside and begged to live, to which Itachi stated that he was not even worth killing. He then told Sasuke to live the rest of his life with hatred and vengeance towards him.\nBack in the present, as Kisame and Itachi contemplate how best to carry Naruto, Sasuke arrives. Kisame is shocked at seeing Sasuke, not only because he looks similar to Itachi, but because he too possesses the Sharingan. Itachi tells him that Sasuke is his younger brother, which Kisame finds funny as he had believed that Itachi had murdered every single Uchiha. Sasuke tells Itachi that he has been living this entire time with hatred in his heart, his only purpose in life to kill Itachi. Sasuke then rushes at Itachi with his Chidori. Uninterested in their quarrel, Itachi easily stops the attack. To try and help Sasuke, Naruto uses the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's chakra in an attempt to summon a toad, though Kisame uses his blade to absorb and devour the chakra. As Kisame prepares to attack Naruto, a toad arrives to block the would-be attack, followed by Jiraiya.",

Standing to his feet again, Sasuke tells Naruto to stay out of his own fight, but is easily beaten down by Itachi, who tells his brother that he is still too weak and he still hasn't mustered enough hatred. Deeming it necessary to make him stronger, Itachi activated Tsukuyomi and forced Sasuke to relive his parents' and other clan members deaths. As Naruto rushes forward to aid his comrade, Kisame prepared to attack him, but Jiraiya uses the Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind technique to stop the two Akatsuki members.\nThe entire area became the oesophagus of the Mountain Toad, with Kisame's foot and sword already starting to be absorbed as Jiraiya began explaining his technique. Sasuke was absorbed into the wall, thus being saved from Itachi. Itachi instructed Kisame that it was time to flee, knowing that the only way they could survive this technique was to escape. Itachi is forced to use Amaterasu to burn a hole in the toad's oesophagus, allowing them to escape; Jiraiya then seals away the flames, remarking that it had to be a powerful technique to burn through and allow them to escape.\nAs Jiraiya and Naruto are checking on Sasuke, Guy suddenly appears out of nowhere and kicks the Sannin in the face with his Dynamic Entry. He had thought that Naruto and Jiraiya were Itachi and Kisame after using the reflection from his forehead protector to check what was ahead. He had seen two figures in the dull reflection, so he had automatically assumed that Itachi and Kisame were still there. Naruto thinks back on Sasuke's defeat at Itachi's hands. He resolves to go after Itachi and Kisame for doing that to Sasuke, but is quickly shot down by a more realistic Jiraiya, who tells him that he is nowhere near Itachi and Kisame's league. Naruto learns that Kakashi was also struck with the same technique Itachi used on Sasuke, and Guy mentions that they need a medical specialist to help, not only with Kakashi and Sasuke, but with Lee as well. Jiraiya tells Guy the person he needed was the one whom they were searching for: the healing specialist, queen of slugs and elixirs, legendary Sannin, and failed gambler, Tsunade.",

At the same time, Tsunade decides to partake in gambling at Machijūtoba, a casino where the big bets are made. Tsunade uses all of her cash, exciting the head gambler as he is aware of her reputation.\nMeanwhile, Naruto enjoys a day out on the town while Jiraiya does some investigating into Tsunade's whereabouts. Naruto reveals that he has saved up a lot of money and plans to use it during the festival; Jiraiya takes away his savings, advising Naruto that it is for his own benefit, to avoid overspending. Naruto uses his allotted money to enjoy the various food and games at the festival. Having depleted his allowance buying food for himself and Jiraiya, Naruto sets off to find his sensei. Naruto finds Jiraiya in a room with two women drinking sake, infuriated that Jiraiya has spent all of his savings. As he lashes out at Jiraiya, two men enter the room, and Naruto accidentally throws the squid he was holding at the stranger's coat, creating a stain. As the two men begin to cause trouble, Jiraiya advises Naruto to pay attention. Forming a blue sphere of chakra in his hand, Jiraiya hits the man in the stomach and sends him flying away with incredible force. The man then recognises Jiraiya, and in fear, hands him his wallet. Jiraiya uses some of the money to pay for the stand he accidentally destroyed and uses the rest to buy balloons and water balloons.\nReady to begin their training, Jiraiya gives Naruto a balloon. Jiraiya explains that Naruto must combine his Tree Climbing Practice as well as his Water Surface Walking Practice in order to spin the water inside the balloon. Naruto proudly states that he understands, and thus begins his training.",

  "description": "Soon after his training begins, Naruto finds himself unable to make any progress. After asking Jiraiya for tips, Naruto decides he'll master the jutsu in three days. Jiraiya doubts the likelihood that Naruto will live up to this promise, explaining that the technique's creator, the Fourth Hokage, took three years to develop the Rasengan in its current form. He then goes on to explain that popping the water balloon is only one of three steps to mastering the technique, and leaves Naruto to resume his training. Over the next three days, Naruto practices by himself in the woods as Jiraiya entertains himself with the women in town. He is unable to find success until he spots the hotel's cat spinning and bursting his water balloon. Seeing this, Naruto comes up with an idea to burst the water balloon – by keeping it steady in his left hand, he uses his right hand to create chakra and rotate the water inside the balloon in different directions until it pops. Although unorthodox, as it requires two hands instead of one, Jiraiya states that he has passed the first stage and that they are moving on to stage two.\nThe second stage involves bursting the balloon again; however, unlike the first, the second stage involves a rubber ball instead of a water balloon, making it harder to pop. Naruto demands help, but Jiraiya states that Naruto isn't a child anymore and that he must figure things out. As Naruto continues to train over the next several days, Jiraiya tells Naruto to go to town and fetch food for the two of them. While in town, Naruto witnesses a father and a son sharing a popsicle. Naruto asks Jiraiya if he'd be willing to stay and spend the day and help him, but Jiraiya repeats his earlier words and tells Naruto to do things himself.\nOver the next three weeks, Jiraiya leaves Naruto to his own devices and continues to mingle with the townswomen. Feeling immense pain in his arms and still unable to burst the balloon, Naruto decides to hold the balloon in both hands and force chakra into the balloon until it bursts, despite the pain he feels in both hands. Pushing himself to his limit, Naruto manages to cause a hole in the balloon. Although disappointed that he wasn't able to burst it, Naruto is congratulated by Jiraiya. Jiraiya offers a popsicle to Naruto, who accepts it happily.",

  "description": "Back in Otogakure, Orochimaru is in immense pain after having the use of his arms taken away by the Third Hokage. He sends Kabuto to locate Tsunade, a famed medical-nin who might be able to heal his arms. After managing to locate her, Kabuto and Orochimaru head out.\nAfter Naruto struggles with the second step of his training, Jiraiya helps him by drawing a spiral on his palm to give him a point to concentrate his efforts on. Naruto recalls Iruka sensei's words of advice regarding concentration from his childhood, and he changes the spiral on his palm to that of a leaf. He then focuses a lot of chakra into that point of concentration; the process causes the balloon to burst, but also for Naruto to go flying backwards, paving the dirt. He is stopped by Jiraiya, who notices that the amount of chakra used managed to burn Naruto's hands. Impressed, he tells Naruto that he has passed the second stage. Naruto is eager to begin the third, but Jiraiya tells him that for now, they must continue on their journey, for he has managed to locate Tsunade. Elsewhere, Tsunade, an avid and extremely unlucky gambler, hits a winning streak, leading her to believe something bad is about to happen. As she tries to leave the city with Shizune and Tonton, she is met by Orochimaru and Kabuto, who greet her by summoning snakes and destroying the castle she was walking past.",

Suspicious of Jiraiya's reason for searching for her, Tsunade asked what he wanted, to which he replied that Konoha wanted her to be the new Hokage. He even found out that Tsunade and Shizune had already found out about the Third's death and encountered Orochimaru along the way. She immediately rejected the offer, saying that anyone who would willingly take the title was a fool. Naruto, enraged that she would disrespect the title of Hokage and those who had held its position so bluntly, challenged Tsunade to a battle. The two stepped outside, and it was very clear that the Sannin is more powerful, as Tsunade sent Naruto flying by using only her index finger. Then she asked him what made him care about the Hokage so much. Naruto replies to her that his dream is to be Hokage someday. Tsunade then thought of her two most beloved Nawaki and Dan and their hopes of being Hokage as well. Naruto noticed she had lowered her guard, and unwilling to give up, he readied his imperfect Rasengan for an attack.",

She then berates Jiraiya for trying to teach Naruto a technique that he couldn't possibly master. Naruto insists that he could, and bets that he could master it in three days. Naruto's personality reminds Tsunade of her deceased loved ones, so she accepts the bet, giving Naruto a week to master it. If Naruto won, she would accept that he could become Hokage, and would give him her incredibly valuable necklace that had originally belonged to the First Hokage. If he loses, then she would get to keep Gama-chan, his purse full of money. Naruto accepts her terms and decides to begin training. Later that night, Jiraiya comes to sit next to Tsunade at a shop, and the two discuss her lover, her brother, Naruto and Orochimaru. Jiraiya reminds her that her loved ones all died for the village, and that if she helps Orochimaru, their deaths would be in vain. Meanwhile, Shizune talks to Naruto about Tsunade's past and about the history of the necklace. Shizune explains that the necklace wasn't an ordinary necklace, and that if anyone except Tsunade wore it, that person would die. While Shizune was talking to Naruto, Tsunade is sitting on top of the gate of Tanzaku Quarters, thinking back on her brother and her lover, both of whom died and whose deaths she could not prevent.",

At first, Jiraya rejects but after Tsunade hoaxes him that there will be pretty women out there, Jiraya agrees. During this conversation, two strangers spy on the group. During their stay, Naruto Uzumaki learns that the two are Senta and Bunzō (two members of the Akagi gang) who cannot return home unless they collect Tsunade's debts, and attempts to help the two. Shizune, fearing that Tsunade's debts, if exposed, would jeopardise her chances of becoming Hokage, disguises herself as Tsunade to stop Naruto, but neither of them realises that the debt had already been paid a time ago.",

Aoi sees his Sharingan up close and realises that he is a member of the Uchiha Clan, and remarks how the last of the clan is nothing but a failure who cannot live up to the family name and their Kekkei Genkai. Infuriated at Aoi's words, Sasuke attempts to kill Aoi with his Chidori again, but only manages to cause a crack in Aoi's Sword of the Thunder God. Aoi then throws Sasuke off a bridge, with Sakura following him in order to save his life. With Sakura and Sasuke out of the fight, it is up to Naruto to defeat him so that Idate can continue the race. Naruto attempts to hit Aoi with his Rasengan, only to fail as Aoi's sword is able to go through chakra. After attempting another Rasengan and using the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to attack, Naruto notices the crack Sasuke had caused. Creating more shadow clones to distract Aoi, Naruto goes airbone and aims for the crack. hitting it with the Rasengan. The tactic works, and Aoi's sword is broken; Aoi himself is sent into the air and then down the cliff. With Aoi defeated, Naruto helps Idate catch up to Fukusuke.\nThough Fukusuke is already near the finish line, with determination and encouragement from Naruto, Idate manages to catch up and win the race, seemingly saving the Wasabi family in the nick of time. However, the daimyō's minister objects, claiming that Idate cheated, as Naruto carried him for part of the race. According to the minister, this violates the rule that the runners must do the race on their own two legs. Just as it seems that Idate will be disqualified and the Wasabi family will be disbanded forever, the daimyō objects, declaring that no such rule exists. He then reveals a photo of the minister taking a bribe from the Wagarashi family, explaining why he had invented the rule. As a result of this, as well as other poor conduct, the Wagarashi are forcibly disbanded for all time.\nAs Idate's win has completed their mission, it is time for Team 7 to return to Konoha. Ibiki Morino arrives on a ship to transport them and the wounded Sasuke back to the village. Idate calls out to his brother, but Ibiki ignores him, stating that he has no brother anymore. Idate thinks to himself that he is now worthy of his brother, as he finally understands the 10th question, while Ibiki privately muses to himself how Idate has finally grown, crediting his growth to Naruto. Meanwhile, Sasuke is fuming on the ship, as he was unable to defeat Aoi despite using Chidori twice, while Naruto managed to kill Aoi.",

Admiring the damage his Chidori has done to his water tower, Sasuke believes himself to be stronger than Naruto. After closer inspection, he finds Naruto's tower to be completely destroyed on one side, and only comes to envy Naruto's strength even more. Kakashi is amazed that Naruto has learned and mastered the Rasengan and realises it must have been Jiraiya who taught it to him. Kakashi berates Jiraiya for teaching Naruto the Rasengan, stating that the technique was too powerful for Naruto to handle and that it could have killed Sasuke; Jiraiya rebuffs by stating that Kakashi should not talk, as he had taught Sasuke the Chidori, and Sasuke's Chidori could have killed Naruto. Jiraiya also states that he should have not taught Sasuke such a technique, as Sasuke is hell bent on revenge. Kakashi likens the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke to that of Jiraiya and Orochimaru, adding that Naruto views Sasuke as his greatest rival while Sasuke cannot handle Naruto's growing strength and admirable progress.\nLater, Kakashi ties Sasuke up to talk to him and lectures him about not attacking his comrades. Kakashi advises him to abandon his quest for vengeance, but Sasuke states that Kakashi would not understand until the day when he loses everyone important to him. Kakashi tells Sasuke that everyone closest to him has already been killed, and adds that the Chidori is not a tool used against a comrade. He tells Sasuke that despite their mutual losses, they are both lucky enough to find friends to fill the void. Kakashi then leaves Sasuke to make his judgment call. Sasuke contemplates whether to accept Naruto and Sakura as his friends or to continue on with his goal of killing Itachi when he is attacked by the Sound Four, sent by Orochimaru to retrieve Sasuke.\nMeanwhile, Sakura asks Naruto out on a walk in order to tell him about the cursed seal that Orochimaru had placed on Sasuke during the Chūnin Exams, as Naruto had been unconscious and was unaware of it at the time. Sakura remembers that Kakashi had told her that he had handled it, but is worried nonetheless about the cursed seal affecting Sasuke.",

After they explain that they were once on Sasuke's level though got stronger once joining Orochimaru, they extend an invitation to Sasuke to accompany them to Orochimaru's lair. After doing so, they leave, allowing Sasuke to consider the matter. The appeal of gaining strength is too much to turn down, and Sasuke makes his way for Konoha's exit. On his way, he meets Sakura, who realises that Sasuke is about to turn his back on the village. She pleads with him to stay, telling him how much she loves him, even offering to help him with his revenge. Unfortunately, she is unable to convince him. Sasuke's cryptic last words before swiftly knocking her out and departing are \"Sakura… thank you\". He knocks her out then leaves Konoha in the company of the Sound Four.",

  "description": "After being caught by Sakon and Ukon's Explosive Tags, Shikamaru decides to ask the Sound Four if they could simply talk it out rather than fighting; however, this is a ruse so that Naruto, Kiba, Akamaru, and Chōji could attack. Kidōmaru manages to ensnare all of them using his spider webs before they can launch a counterattack. Kiba drops a Smoke Bomb, despite Kidōmaru stating that it was futile since they were all trapped in his webs. Shikamaru, however, manages to trap them with his Shadow Imitation Technique, explaining that he had attempted to get caught just so that he could have trapped them. Sakon manages to free the Sound Four out of Shikamaru's shadow, and Jirōbō immediately traps them with his Earth Release Barrier: Earth Prison Dome of Magnificent Nothingness.\nShikamaru berates himself for getting his team caught in such a trap while Kiba attempts to break his way out using his Passing Fang technique. Kiba manages to create a huge dent in the wall, only for the wall to heal itself. Neji notices that the dome is imbued with chakra, and that it will heal any damage done to it; on top of that, their own chakra itself is being absorbed by Jirōbō. Shikamaru asks Jirōbō if he could free their team in exchange for them not pursuing Sasuke; when Jirōbō refuses, Shikamaru then asks if Jirōbō could free just him in exchange for the lives of his teammates. This infuriates both Naruto and Kiba, but Neji and Chōji realise it is nothing but a ruse. Chōji starts eating, much to the dismay of Naruto and Kiba. However, Chōji tells them to remember what Shikamaru had told them before setting off on their mission (he told them that as team leader, he would be ready to lay down his life for the mission and that he was also responsible for the lives of his teammates). Neji adds that when Kiba first attacked the dome, Shikamaru was paying attention to the damage Kiba was causing, and how some parts of the dome healed slower than the others. He goes on to further explain that Shikamaru trying to sell the team out was just a ruse in order to determine where Jirōbō's location was. Proving Shikamaru's theory right, the wall Jirōbō was feeding off of had the strongest chakra lining, whereas the opposite side had the thinnest, meaning it was the weakest part of the dome.\nShikamaru asks Kiba if he could try causing damage to the dome again, and Kiba agrees. Transforming Akamaru into a Beast Human Clone and using the Four Legs Technique on himself, the pair perform their Fang Passing Fang technique, causing damage all around the dome. Shikamaru asks Neji to pinpoint the slowest-healing point of the dome wall and to throw a kunai there to mark the spot. After he does so, Shikamaru tells Chōji to break the wall, as Neji states that only powerful taijutsu can destroy the dome. Chōji uses his Human Bullet Tank technique and manages to break through the dome, freeing the entire team.",

  "description": "Back in Otogakure, Orochimaru is in immense pain as his arms are bleeding profusely. Kabuto tells Orochimaru that he will die unless he takes over someone else's body, even offering his own, but Orochimaru claims that Sasuke is the only vessel he will take. Kabuto, however, tells Orochimaru that it doesn't look like the Sound Four will bring Sasuke to Oto in time, and that he must take a new vessel quickly before he dies. Kabuto then releases all of the prisoners who he and Orochimaru experimented on, and promises to release only one of them. The prisoners then fight each other to the death so that the sole survivor may be granted freedom. Kabuto then goes to check on Kimimaro, a loyal follower of Orochimaru who is terminally ill and thus bed-ridden. It is revealed that Kimimaro was the leader of what used to be known as the Sound Five, and that he was to be the vessel for Orochimaru, until he was afflicted with his disease. As he no longer has any purpose for Orochimaru as his vessel, Kimimaro believes his existence has lost all meaning; however, he finds himself a chance to redeem his existence when he decides to devote his remaining lifespan to ensure that Sasuke, Orochimaru's future vessel, is brought to Otogakure.\nMeanwhile, the Sasuke Recovery Team is catching up to Tayuya and Sakon and Ukon. Kiba and Akamaru decide to wait until it's dark to ambush them, but Shikamaru states that they will be fumbling blindly in the dark while also giving up their positions, thereby giving the enemy the advantage; on top of that, Shikamaru would be unable to use his Shadow Imitation Technique. Despite Kiba's protests, Naruto states that they need to trust in their team leader's plan.\nAfter fighting each to the death, Gen'yūmaru, the sole surviving prisoner, is chosen to be Orochimaru's new vessel. Orochimaru promises to grant him one wish before taking his body, and Gen'yūmaru asks if Orochimaru could stop performing experiments on the members of his clan. Orochimaru gives his word to Gen'yūmaru before using his Living Corpse Reincarnation technique to take over Gen'yūmaru's body. At the same time, Kimimaro leaves Otogakure to retrieve Sasuke.\nAs Tayuya, Sakon and Ukon run through the forests, they wonder what is taking Jirōbō and Kidōmaru so long to catch up. They stop after Tayuya notices a kick from within the container Sasuke is in. Before she can check on it, she spots Naruto watching them from a tree branch. As she guards the container, Sakon and Ukon try to take down Naruto, only to be ambushed by Kiba and Shikamaru. As Sakon deals with those two, Naruto uses his Shadow Clone Technique and prepares his Rasengan. It turns out that \"Kiba\" and \"Shikamaru\" are none other than transformed shadow clones, and Naruto tries to hit Sakon with his Rasengan, only for Sakon to grab his hand and dispel the technique. The real Kiba then uses his Passing Fang to go through Naruto, who is revealed to be just a shadow clone, in an attempt to hit Sakon. Sakon easily jumps out the way, but Kiba keeps going, heading towards Tayuya. Realising that she was the intended target all along, Tayuya attempts to grab the container containing Sasuke and flee, only to be trapped in place by Shikamaru and his Shadow Imitation technique. Kiba manages to cancel his Passing Fang right before he hits Tayuya, and grabs the container and tosses it to Naruto. Sakon, who is plummeting towards Kiba, is unable to change his trajectory and heads towards Tayuya. Shikamaru cancels his technique just before Sakon hits Tayuya, avoiding getting injured himself. The team then take the container and flee, only for an incensed Sakon to activate his cursed seal and go after them.",

After getting hit by one, Sakon retaliates by trapping Akamaru, who is standing next to an explosive tag. Kiba jumps down to save Akamaru and Sakon heads after Kiba. As the tag explodes, Sakon, Kiba and Akamaru both plummet off the end of a cliff and fall down. Before Naruto and Shikamaru can further assess the situation, Tayuya comes after them. However, she stops her attack when she instantly notices Kimimaro, who has snuck up behind Naruto and Shikamaru. He manages to kick the container containing Sasuke off the tree branch and goes after it, catching it. Telling Tayuya that she has disappointed Orochimaru, he wishes to kill her; however, he tells her he will refrain from doing so as she has a duty to perform. Taking Sasuke with him, Kimimaro instructs Tayuya to eliminate Naruto and Shikamaru.\nAs they cannot let Sasuke get away, Shikamaru and Naruto devise a strategy; Naruto and Shikamaru rush toward Tayuya, but Shikamaru pulls back at the last second while Naruto soars over Tayuya. As Tayuya stands there confused, Shikamaru attempts to trap her using his Shadow Imitation Technique, but Tayuya manages to avoid being caught just in time. However, Naruto manages to get away, and follows Kimimaro. His anger towards the Sound Four and Kimimaro causes him to release some of the Nine-Tails' chakra. Naruto manages to catch up to Kimimaro in a clearing, and the latter is surprised to see that Naruto possesses much more chakra than most. Naruto demands to know why Orochimaru wants Sasuke. Kimimaro explains that Orochimaru wishes to live forever; while his soul can live forever, his body cannot, therefore Orochimaru must need new host bodies to use as vessels. Angered that Orochimaru is planning to take over Sasuke's body, Naruto uses the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra to produce a thousand shadow clones. Back in the forest, Tayuya mocks Shikamaru's leadership, believing he has sacrificed a member of his team every time they engage one of the Sound Four one-on-one. Shikamaru states that he does not believe any of his team members are dead, and tells Tayuya not to insult them. Tayuya responds by summoning three giants, whom she controls with her Demonic Flute. At the same time, Kiba is fighting Sakon, who manages to kick Kiba away.",

Naruto begins his battle, creating a great deal of shadow clones to attack Kimimaro, who, however, is able to defeat the clones. As the fight between Kiba and Akamaru vs. Sakon and Ukon rages on, Ukon pushes his cursed seal into its second level. Recognising the huge increase in strength that this allows the brothers, Kiba and Akamaru combine to become a giant double-headed wolf. The combined beast charges towards Sakon and Ukon, and bisects them. However, the brothers' internal organs creates new legs and arms. Kiba and Akamaru charge at them again, though the brothers are able to use Summoning: Rashōmon to block the attack. As the wolf transformation disperses, Akamaru is attacked and left heavily injured, although Akamaru manages to squirt acidic urine into Sakon's eyes. Sakon goes to wash his eyes in the river while Ukon merges himself with Kiba's body. Needing to get rid of Ukon to save Akamaru, Kiba stabs himself in the stomach, causing him and Ukon to start coughing up blood.",

  "description": "Despite Tayuya's efforts, Shikamaru devised a plan to defeat her creatures. Using his remaining kunai and shuriken to distract her and her giants, he triggered a flash bomb he had planted above her. The light from the flash bomb extended his shadows long enough for him to trap all three of her creatures with his Shadow Imitation Technique. He then tells her that he will be using her very own pawns against her, but Tayuya does not seem to care. Shikamaru tells her to at least arm herself, and she tells him that her flute is her only weapon. Shikamaru and her creatures charge at Tayuya, but Tayuya is able to dispel her creatures. Shikamaru voices his frustration, causing Tayuya to laugh at him for thinking he had a chance. However, just as she attempts to kill him, she finds herself trapped by Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique. He tells her that, just like in a game of shōgi, the first move is always a fakeout, whereas the second move is the final strike.\nTrapped and unable to move, Tayuya advanced her cursed seal to its second state in order to use the strength and chakra it provides to break free of Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique. Shikamaru attempts to hold her in place with the advanced Shadow–Neck Binding Technique, which seems to work; however, while her body is kept bound by his jutsu, her fingers are free to move, and she uses her flute to place Shikamaru within a genjutsu. As the genjutsu causes Shikamaru to scream in pain, Tayuya picks up one of Shikamaru's kunai knives and rushes towards him to kill him. Just as she gets close, Shikamaru punches her in the gut. Wondering how he ever got out of her genjutsu, she notices that he had manipulated his shadow to break his own finger, and used the pain to break out of her genjutsu. Shikamaru then uses his Shadow-Neck Binding Technique on her again, telling her that the closer he is to his target, the tighter the bind his jutsu inflicts. As Tayuya berates herself for her carelessness, Shikamaru reveals that it was all according to his plan - once Tayuya revealed that her flute was her only weapon, he knew that once she thought she caught him, she would need to arm herself to kill him, and that she would pick up that kunai closest to her and come near him to finish him off.",

  "description": "As Naruto starts getting frustrated with his lack of progress, Sasuke's cursed seal finally reaches its second level, allowing him to exit his coffin. Sasuke's appearance snaps Naruto out of his Nine-Tails mood and he encourages Sasuke to return home with him, stating that everyone is waiting for him in Konoha. Sasuke does not comply or respond, instead cackling rather madly which leaves Naruto enraged. Sasuke leaves the enclosure with Naruto attempting to follow, although Kimimaro prevents Naruto from going after Sasuke, intending to kill Naruto. Luckily, the arrival of the newly recovered Rock Lee blocks Kimimaro's attack and saves Naruto. Lee tells Naruto to go after Sasuke, reminding him of his promise to Sakura. Lee and Kimimaro begin exchanging blows, though Kimimaro's unique control over his bones makes things difficult for Lee. On top of that, Kimimaro finds Lee's moves to be predictable. Soon after the fight begins, Lee asks for a timeout so that he can take his medicine. Kimimaro lets him, and Lee drinks the contents of his medicine bottle.\nBack in Konoha, Guy returns from his mission and rushes to the hospital to ask Tsunade how Lee's operation went. Tsunade tells him it was a success and that Lee could begin training as early as tomorrow, only for two aides to rush in and claim that Lee is missing. Tsunade realises that Lee must have gone after the Sasuke Recovery Team in order to help out. She also realises that Lee took a bottle of sake instead of his medicine, which causes Guy to freak out. Guy explains that even a sip of alcohol turns Lee extremely inebriated, and reveals that when he is not sober, Lee can be very dangerous and devastating, since he is a natural master at the art of the Drunken Fist. Back at the clearing, Lee drinks the sake and becomes inebriated. He assumes the Drunken Fist stance as he prepares to take on Kimimaro.",

  "description": "In his drunken form, Lee's movements are too unpredictable and unorthodox for Kimimaro to match. Lee manages to block and counter every one of Kimimaro's attacks. Lee resorts to feigning tactics such as falling asleep spread-eagled, and he manages to land a hit with his eyes closed and even managed to overpower him. Realising that Lee is drunk and is using the Drunken Fist and possesses high levels of speed, Kimimaro resorts to using his kekkei genkai in order to snap Lee out of it. Kimimaro's tactics work, as Lee sobers up after having his face cut by one of Kimimaro's bones.\nBack in the forest, Shikamaru's Shadow–Neck Binding Technique starts to slowly give way as his chakra runs out. Shikamaru likens this to the previous time his chakra ran out (during the Konoha Crush), in which he was saved by Asuma Sarutobi. Thinking there is no one to save him now, Shikamaru prepares himself for the worst. Meanwhile, Kiba and the wounded Akamaru make their way out of the river and hide behind the trees. However, Sakon disguises his scent using Kiba's jacket and catches the two. At the same time, the now sober Lee decides that he needs to resort to hard-hitting tactics to take down Kimimaro, and decides to open the First Gate and use the Front Lotus; Kimimaro manages to use the density of his bones to absorb the full effect of Lee's Lotus kick.\nKimimaro then attempts to drill his bones into Lee, only for his bones to be blocked by sand, which dispels Lee backwards. The sand manages to cushion Lee's fall. Kimimaro demands who his new opponent is, and Lee is shocked to see that it is none other than Gaara. In the forest, Tayuya is about to finish off Shikamaru when she is hit by a powerful gust of wind, caused by none other than Temari. Meanwhile, Sakon is about to kill Kiba with a kunai when his attack is blocked by Kankurō, who used Karasu to shield Kiba. The Three Sand Siblings announce themselves as shinobi allies of Konohagakure and prepare to help their former enemies in combat.",

  "description": "Gaara arrives just in time to save Lee's life. He mentions that Lee isn't as fast or agile as he was before, and remembers the injuries he inflicted on Lee during the Chūnin Exams. Not wanting Lee to get hurt, Gaara uses his sand to pull Lee back and tells him to sit the fight out. Gaara uses his sand to fight Kimimaro, which prompts Kimimaro to attempt to destroy Gaara's gourd, as he believes it is the only source of sand Gaara possesses. Gaara, however, uses the sand on the ground to restrain Kimimaro and then uses his Sand Drizzle technique followed with a Sand Binding Coffin, although Kimimaro avoids being crushed to death due to his bone density. Gaara decides to use his Sand Waterfall Funeral to attempt to crush Kimimaro again, though by activating his cursed seal, Kimimaro survives the attack. Calling upon a greater amount of Sand, Gaara uses his Quicksand Waterfall Flow to create a sand tsunami and then uses his Sand Waterfall Imperial Funeral technique that not only smothers Kimimaro, but levels the terrain as well. To both Gaara and Kimimaro's surprise, the latter survives the attack.\nGaara mentions to Lee that Kimimaro's eyes remind him of Sasuke's, claiming that their eyes belie the fact that both wish to find the purpose of their existence. Stuck within the sand, Kimimaro reminisces on how he was raised in the darkness, imprisoned in a cell because of his kekkei genkai, only being let out to fight. The clan's patriarch used him as a weapon in an attempt to take down Kirigakure. Kimimaro was tasked with the sole objective of killing any ninja from Kirigakure, and encountered Orochimaru, Zabuza and Haku, the latter two telling Kimimaro that they were not from Kiri in order to avoid a fight. After killing all of those in his way, Kimimaro discovered that the entire Kaguya Clan has been slaughtered as well. Feeling lonely and without a purpose, Kimimaro wandered on his own until he was found by Orochimaru, who took him in. Kimimaro believes that his sole purpose in life is to protect Orochimaru and his goals, hence why he hasn't died yet. Going into the second state of his cursed seal, Kimimaro breaks free of the sand and lunges towards Gaara and Lee.\nMeanwhile, Naruto continues to chase Sasuke in an attempt to convince the former Leaf ninja to return to Konoha.",

  "description": "Kimimaro manages to tackle Gaara, whose sand cushions his fall. His Armour of Sand also absorbs the damage of Kimimaro's strike. Lee decides to use this opportunity to perform an attack behind Kimimaro, though Kimimaro is able to avoid it and nearly kills Lee in the process, with Gaara having saved him. Realising that in his current physical state that he is nothing but a burden, Lee relents and allows Gaara to fight alone. Kimimaro pulls out his spine and uses it to restrain Gaara. He then transforms his right hand into a bone drill in an attempt to bore through Gaara and kill him. Gaara manages to use the hardest minerals in the ground and fuses it into the sand with his chakra to summon his Ultimately Hard Absolute Defence: Shield of Shukaku, which is hard enough not only to prevent Kimimaro's bone drill from boring through but to shatter the bone completely.\nGaara realises that Kimimaro's technique is a kekkei genkai, and Kimimaro tells him that it is a trait that belonged to the Kaguya Clan, and that he is the last of the clan. Gaara tells Kimimaro that the Kaguya Clan will end today with Kimimaro's death, although Kimimaro states that he will continue to live on within Orochimaru. Gaara remarks that Orochimaru has brainwashed Kimimaro well and that the latter is nothing but a pawn. Almost depleted of his chakra, Gaara dispels his Shield of Shukaku while also using the sand around him to release himself from Kimimaro's spine grip. Using his last remaining chakra, Gaara uses his Prison Sand Burial technique to swallow Kimimaro and sink him two hundred meters underground under tight pressure. Enraged at Gaara's remarks about him being nothing but Orochimaru's pawn, Kimimaro uses his ultimate technique which causes thousands of bones to emerge from the ground. Gaara manages to save his and Lee's life by elevating them with his sand. Gaara states that he is out of both strength and chakra while Lee remarks that at least he managed to kill Kimimaro. Right on cue, Kimimaro sprouts from one of the bones with a bone drill in hand prepared to kill Gaara for his remarks regarding Orochimaru. However, before he can kill Gaara, Kimimaro's terminal illness gets the better of him and he dies.\nGaara and Lee manage to descend to safety, with the former contemplating how lucky he was. Lee mentions how Guy once told him that a shinobi makes his own luck, prompting Gaara to accidentally insult Guy and call him a meddlesome fool (as Guy had prevented Gaara from killing Lee earlier). Lee states that while he is grateful to Gaara for saving his life, he will not tolerate any insults geared towards his sensei. Gaara tells Lee that both he and Naruto have that in common - they have people who they care about so much that any attack to that person is an affront to them. Gaara also wonders whether it is better to care and protect an evil person rather than to remain lonely, realising that that is exactly what Kimimaro had done.\nMeanwhile, Naruto manages to catch up to Sasuke at the Valley of the End.",

Naruto lands several blows on Sasuke's face, but even as his blood falls to the ground, he remains the same. Sasuke laughs and tells Naruto that he's not even using his Sharingan. Angered, Naruto attacks again but is blocked and pushed off of the top of the statue. Both falling off, Sasuke ruthlessly beats Naruto to the ground easily where he stays down and tosses the bag of ninja-tools to where Naruto lies. Sasuke begins to remember his childhood and his reasons for becoming obsessed with power. Sasuke's childhood was spent living in his brother, Itachi's, shadow. Being the prodigy of the clan, Itachi received all the attention from their father, leaving Sasuke to live his life trying to earn his father's recognition. Itachi, aware of Sasuke's efforts, did what he could to redirect some of their father's attention to Sasuke, but saw little success. In time, the members of the Uchiha clan began to suspect Itachi of being a murderer, and Itachi started openly attacking and disrespecting the clan.",

Meanwhile, believing Naruto to be his closest friend, Sasuke prepares to kill him, finding the loss of Naruto to be an acceptable price for the Mangekyō Sharingan. Naruto's Rasengan and Sasuke's Chidori clash, though neither is capable of overpowering the other, and they both are sent back flying. Naruto begins to cry for his friend silently, then Sasuke states that if two ninja are of a high enough level, they can read each others by exchanging blows and asks Naruto if he can read his mind.

In tears, Naruto says that he is Sasuke's friend and will not let him defect to Orochimaru even if it means breaking Sasuke's arms and legs to stop him. The boys fight, and Sasuke struggles to counter Naruto's increased speed and strength. After a severe beating, Naruto pins Sasuke against the rock wall and asks him if he has come to senses yet. Sasuke tells Naruto that he could not possibly understand what it feels like to lose his whole family, because Naruto was alone from the very beginning.\nNaruto admits that whereas he knows nothing about parents or siblings, he thinks of Iruka as a father, and he wonders if his relationship with Sasuke is similar to having a brother. Naruto states that to protect this bond, he will stop Sasuke no matter what. Sasuke resists Naruto's appeals and says that it is too late for him to go back. He puts on his forehead protector and calls for Naruto to come, saying that he will break the bonds of their friendship. A third tomoe appears in Sasuke's Sharingan signifying that it is now fully mature. Naruto asks Sasuke why he's bothering with the forehead protector if he seeks to break his bond with Naruto and the rest of Konohagakure. Sasuke explains that he recognises Naruto as an equal, though he once again taunts that Naruto won't even be able to scratch his forehead. Elsewhere, Kakashi catches up to Pakkun and the two hurry to stop Sasuke and Naruto.\nNaruto and Sasuke resume their battle, but this time Sasuke has the upper hand, harnessing the full power of the Sharingan. Naruto uses a chain of shadow clones to throw Sasuke into the cliff wall, but Sasuke counters with Fire Release: Dragon Fire Technique. A half-conscious Naruto again implores Sasuke to stop, but Sasuke declares it is too late and as a finishing move, pile drives Naruto into the ground below. Inside Naruto's subconscious, the Nine-Tailed Fox says that Naruto is too weak and that the boy should be thankful to him. Seemingly defeated, the fox's red chakra begins pouring out of Naruto, who slowly gets up and punches the shocked Sasuke. Naruto grows a chakra tail, makes a very fox-like stance, and attacks Sasuke once more. Sasuke struggles against Naruto's onslaught and notices that the red chakra seems to have a mind of its own.\nSasuke tries using his cursed seal, but even this state is weak in comparison to Naruto's current form. Sasuke laughs and says that Naruto has given him no choice but to use the second level of his cursed seal. As the seal transforms his body, Sasuke's hair grows longer, his nails extend, and his skin turns grey. He acknowledges that Naruto possesses a special power, but says that he is more special.",

  "description": "Sasuke, having activated his Cursed Seal of Heaven level 2, laughs and arrogantly tells Naruto he has a feeling he will not lose. Enraged, Naruto charges at Sasuke, and the two clash sending up a cloud of debris. When the dust settles, Naruto is shocked to see a giant wing coming out of Sasuke's back, which has deflected his attack. Sasuke extends the wing and sends Naruto shooting towards the opposite side of the river.\nA second wing tears through the back of Sasuke's shirt, and he groans in pain. He remembers Sakon's warning not to use the fully released Cursed Seal for too long. Knowing that his body will erode if kept in this state, Sasuke tells himself he hasn't any time to waste. Naruto stands, his left hand completely immobile. He realises the Nine-Tailed Fox form is taking a toll on his body, which Sasuke happily notices as well.\nSasuke tells Naruto that they are fighting in the Valley of the End and that it is the perfect stage for their battle. A series of flashbacks recap the two boys' relationship up to this point: the formation of Team 7; Sasuke's superior abilities; Naruto's incredible improvement; Sasuke's subsequent jealousy; and their inevitable rooftop fight.\nSasuke envisions Itachi's distorted Sharingan, which drives him to form Chidori a third time. Naruto straightens up and forms a Demon Fox Rasengan using only his right hand as his left hand is still out of commission. The strength of Sasuke's Chidori increases, becoming a Flapping Chidori. Both ninja charge at each other with their ultimate techniques. They collide in an explosion of blue and red chakra that forms a swirling black sphere of energy. At the last moment, Sasuke chooses to punch Naruto in the chest rather than impale him with the Chidori. Likewise, Naruto only scratches Sasuke's forehead protector, disproving the boy's earlier taunt and minimising the effects of the Rasengan. Getting closer, Kakashi senses the massive chakra and tells Pakkun to hurry.\nNaruto and Sasuke are left hovering within the sphere, gazing sadly at each other. A vision of a younger Sasuke and Naruto shows the two form a seal as a symbol of friendship, and they smile at each other. The bright light then slowly dissipates and as it fades away, Naruto is shown lying on the ground, unconscious with Sasuke standing above him, revealing that Sasuke has emerged as the victor in their fight. Sun light breaks through the clouds, illuminating the two boys, and focuses to a point on Naruto's face before it disappears altogether. Sasuke stares down at Naruto while Sasuke's own scratched forehead protector loosens and falls to the ground, presumably confirming that Sasuke has severed ties with Konoha. It begins to rain. Sasuke is wracked by a sharp pain in his arm and falls to his hands and knees looking Naruto straight in the face.\nA while later, Kakashi arrives at the scene, but Sasuke is nowhere to be found. Kakashi slowly picks up the fallen Naruto, apologises for not making it in time, and acknowledges what must have been Naruto's desperate effort to save his friend. Sasuke walks through the forest assailed by memories of his parents and brother. He again recalls Itachi's last words to him, that to unlock his Mangekyō Sharingan he must kill his closest friend. Back at the waterfall, Pakkun and Kakashi discuss the irony of Naruto and Sasuke fighting at the Valley of the End and the never-ending battles of the ninja world which like the river will go on forever. Naruto slowly opens his eyes, revealing Sasuke's choice to leave without killing him. Returning to Sasuke in the forest, the boy asserts that he will not do as his brother bids, and that he will obtain power in his own way. Sasuke then walks into the darkness.\nThe rain stops, and Kakashi and Pakkun head for home, Kakashi carrying Naruto on his back. A mysterious man in an Akatsuki cloak rises from the ground and notes that things have become interesting.",

Sakura thinks he's dead and Naruto ends up blowing his sneak attack cover to protect her. Naruto tries his attack again, but his injury causes a problem. Naruto gets trapped in an attack that will crush him if he doesn't get out. Sasame attacks Arashi and manages to set him free for a second. However, it doesn't last long and he soon tries to kill Sasame. Sakura jumps in the way and says she will give her life to protect her friends. Naruto tells her she can't die and Arashi tries to finish Naruto off. Sasame causes a distraction enough for Naruto to break free. The resulting explosion of Naruto's escape from the trap creates shrapnel, which strikes Arashi, freeing him. Arashi protects Sasame from harm, but the lair begins to collapse just as Jiraiya and Gamahiro arrive. Arashi throws Sasame to Jiraiya and tells them he can't leave since he is a puppet. He tells Naruto that Sasuke is alive and being protected as a vessel until Orochimaru can reincarnate again in three years. After hearing this the group leaves, leaving Arashi behind. The Fūma clan promises to rebuild their town and everyone heads back to Konoha. Back in Konoha, Shikamaru remarks to Tsunade that a medical-nin should be part of all small platoons. Tsunade acknowledges that she wrote the same thing once, but training to become a medical ninja requires special qualities that few possess. Considering herself to have been of little use, Sakura asks to become Tsunade's apprentice and learn to become a medical-nin, to which Tsunade agrees.",

It turned out to be a trap, as the Kurosuki family then ambushed them. Luckily, Naruto fooled them not once, but twice, with his clones. With the enemies defeated, the villagers focused their anger on Karashi. Rock Lee intercepted them and said that Karashi was still young and weak, and that it was partially his fault that Karashi had joined the Kurosuki family. Lee begged them to let Karashi return to his mother, promising to punish Karashi himself if he should fall from grace again. The villagers agreed, and the group headed back, but not before picking up Ranmaru. They headed back to the Curry of Life shop for a meal, where Naruto tried to retrieve information from Ranmaru. Ranmaru had Karashi take him to the canyon where Raiga had fallen, and used his own chakra to revive him.",

Meanwhile, Naruto spoke of his encounter with Isaribi earlier. The episode then moved to Anko's sudden reflection on her memories. She saw Orochimaru approaching towards her, telling her that the Hokage had found out about their experiments. Shino, Naruto and Ino decided to continue with their original mission: to protect the official payments and to capture the Kaima.\nThe group headed to Demon Island, an island located in the Land of the Sea where supposedly the Kaima resided. Anko awoke and explained that the Kaima was a human who had undergone physical transmutations. Whilst they were talking, Yoroi and Isaribi headed underwater to Orochimaru's lair. Inside, Isaribi passed on the information relating to the official payments, and asked when she would return to normal. Yoroi told her that she was a prototype and that, when he was done collecting information from her, he would change her back. He then sent her to dispatch Naruto and the rest of the group, who had just arrived on the shore.\nShino, Naruto and Ino found themselves in an experimental laboratory with many creatures contained in test pillars. Isaribi approached from behind and triggered a trapdoor. The three Genin fell through the trapdoor, after which Anko appeared behind Isaribi with a kunai at her throat. Isaribi managed to escape, and left Anko locked in the room to face three large lion-like mutations. Anko made quick work of the three.\nThe rest of the team faced Yoroi Akadō, who was working for the enemy. Shino accepted his challenge while Naruto and Ino continued on to meet up with Anko. Anko, Naruto and Ino then found themselves facing Amachi and Isaribi. Amachi and Isaribi ran off just as Misumi Tsurugi appeared to face them. Ino used her mind manipulation jutsu to restrain him. Shino's opponent disappeared as the island began to collapse. Isaribi, Amachi and Yoroi escaped on a ship, leaving Team Anko to perish in the collapsing building. Naruto began to frantically search for an exit.",

Along the way, he meets a unique ninja called a Courier Ninja who's mission duties were solely to deliver mail through the most difficult and dangerous of terrains. At the village, much to his shock and fury, Naruto discovers Jiraiya fooling around with some girls. To calm Naruto down, Jiraiya reveals the real reason he hasn't started Naruto's training yet was that he was on a mission to gather information on the Akatsuki and learned that an agent of theirs was reported to be arriving in the village soon. Naruto asked Jiraiya to train him since they had the time, but Jiraiya explained he also had to finish the manuscript for his latest novel. After constant procrastination on Jiraiya's part, he eventually fell asleep with his work unfinished. Naruto instead decided to ghostwrite the manuscript for Jiraiya and had a courier ninja deliver it, after bumping into a couple of men and getting their mail mixed together.\nWhen Naruto told Jiraiya what he did, Jiraiya was furious as he feared this would ruin his career as an author. After getting the mail back, Jiraiya was horrified to discover that the package contained a peace treaty between the Land of Fang and Claw who were on the brink of war. Realising that Naruto's manuscript was being sent to the Fang Daimyō and fearing that the Fang Daimyō would view as an insult for war, Jiraiya and Naruto rushed to get the manuscript back. After a heated struggle against the courier ninja, the Fang Daimyō, unfortunately, got the manuscript. But to Naruto and Jiraiya's shock, the Fang Daimyō was a huge fan of the Icha Icha series and thought it was a peace offering from the Land of Claw, effectively causing the war to be cancelled. Later, Jiraiya had to leave as his Akatsuki target had already left the hot springs resort, forcing Naruto to return to Konoha to wait for Jiraiya's return.",

The Onbaa started causing havoc wherever Naruto goes. Despite Naruto's efforts, it remains firmly attached to Naruto's back. Tsunade mentions that Jiraiya once went on an expedition when they were kids to find the Onbaa. Tsunade refused to believe that he could find one, however, Orochimaru stated that he was \"betting on Jiraiya this time\" before quickly turning around so that no one could see him and began blushing with embarrassment at his sudden outburst and for the fact that he never normally agreed with Jiraiya. Jiraiya then headed into the woods around Konoha and returned sometime later having written a report on Onbaa's, claiming that he had fought one, although Tsunade paid him no heed at the time, believing him to be a fool. The Onbaa continues to increase in size, eventually becoming larger than Naruto himself. However, during a mission, it aids Naruto, causing Naruto to reconsider their relationship, but the Onbaa's mother appears, driving Naruto off and claiming her offspring. The child manages to calm the mother, and the two leave. As Naruto returns to the village, most of the inhabitants have Onbaa on their backs, something Naruto finds absolutely hilarious and advises Tsunade to fight the Onbaa like Jiraiya said.",

After initially believing Naruto came to challenge him and slamming him through a wall, Lee explained he built his dōjō in the hopes that skilled warriors of various disciplines would come to challenge him so he could improve his skill for combat. After narrowly escaping Lee's request to face him, Naruto bumped into Guy and told him about Lee's dōjō. Guy, who was so proud of his student's dedication to improve, decided to help Lee by disguising himself (albeit a very poor disguise) and challenging Lee. Unfortunately, Guy was called by Tsunade to go and help Team 10 who reported some trouble. Unbeknownst to him and Naruto, a thief named Nanafushi who came to Konoha to steal its secrets impersonated Guy as he left. Naruto, thinking he was really Guy, dragged him to Lee's dōjō. Not wanting to break character, Nanafushi challenged Lee and was quickly defeated.\nNanafushi managed to convince Naruto he was just exhausted and had Naruto fill in for him. Knowing he couldn't beat Lee in direct combat, Naruto relied on various shadow clone tactics. Before the fight could be finished, Nanafushi (who now disguised himself as Lee) was knocked out cold by the real Guy. After getting their facts straight on who was who, they brought Nanafushi to Tsunade, unaware of who he was. Immediately after Tsunade gave them orders to search for and capture Nanafushi, they handed him over to Tsunade. This was the fastest mission that Naruto has ever completed successfully.",

  "description": "The list of authors can be seen in the page history there.\n\n\nWhen the daimyō's wife, Kayo of the Land of Honey went missing, Naruto was sent on a mission to find her with Hinata and Kiba. Upon arriving at the princess' last known location, they found a large castle and decided to investigate, much to Naruto's disapproval due to his fear of the supernatural. Soon after entering, the team began finding all kinds of strange things happening like people in pictures moving and books flying. Soon it became clear that the castle was not what it appears. It was later discovered that fifty years ago the ruler of the castle, Kōza Kubisaki, placed a \"curse\" on the castle so all who entered it would be devoured. Hinata then used her Byakugan to discover that the castle was somehow alive. After discovering this, the castle appearance changed to what appeared to be the insides of a giant creature. They were able to discover that the creature was actually a giant chameleon summon that had been carrying out its dead master's orders for over fifty years. Through the surprising help of the spirit of Kōza they were able to find the summon's summoning scroll and destroy it, causing the summoning to disappear. Naruto and his team were barely able to escape with Kayo and her men. Afterwards, Naruto and his team surmised that Kōza simply wanted their help to finally let the summoning go home.",

Placed at number two, the battle between Neji and Kidōmaru is displayed. Neji also expresses his views and afterwards, hits Naruto with the Gentle Fist. Placed at the top, the battle between Naruto and Sasuke at the Valley of the End is displayed. Some random videos of Sakura beating Naruto are also showcased.

Bandits steal the artefact, and when Naruto saves Shin'emon after he puts his life at risk to try to save the artefact, he teaches him that people are more valuable than possessions. It is also revealed that Shin'emon is the creator of the artefact and can easily make another.",

  "description": "Tsunade tells Naruto that she has prepared an opponent for Naruto test his skills against. Before she can finish, two ninja knock on the door and enter - none other than Shikamaru and Temari. Sakura proudly tells Shikamaru to guess who has returned, and it takes Shikamaru a few seconds to realise that it is Naruto, while Temari ponders whether the Naruto standing in front of her is the same Naruto she once knew. Naruto asks whether Shikamaru is his opponent, and Shikamaru tells him that he has no clue what Naruto is talking about, as he is here only to drop off some paperwork. Tsunade tells Naruto that his opponent is right outside. Naruto then opens the window and sees his old sensei, Kakashi, sitting there reading Icha Icha. Naruto decides to bestow a present to Kakashi, and gives Kakashi the latest volume of Icha Icha that Jiraiya wrote, which has not even been released yet. Kakashi is overwhelmed, but Tsunade tells him to get a grip. Naruto then asks Kakashi if he is his opponent, and Kakashi states that he is both his and Sakura's opponent; Tsunade not only wished to test Naruto's training that Jiraiya put him under, but also the training she gave to Sakura. However, as Kakashi wants to start reading the book Naruto gave him, he tells Naruto that they cannot begin the exercise now since Naruto must be tired from his journey.\nAs Naruto berates Kakashi for leaving them just to read the book, Sakura decides that they should take the time to discuss an ample strategy to use against Kakashi. The pair are tailed by Shikamaru and Temari, prompting Naruto to bluntly ask them if they are a couple. Shikamaru and Temari both protest, and explain that they are both representatives of their respective villages for the upcoming Chūnin Exams. Shikamaru then asks Naruto if he is going to be participating in the exams, as he is the only one from their year who is still a genin. Naruto is shell-shocked at this revelation, after finding out that even Sakura made Chūnin. Shikamaru goes on to add that Neji, Kankurō and Temari have even reached Jōnin rank. Naruto is amazed that they have become Jōnin, but quickly interrupts himself to ask what became of Gaara, and finds out that Gaara has become the Kazekage of Sunagakure. He proudly announces that he will not be outdone by Gaara and that his dream is still to be Hokage.\nMeanwhile, Jiraiya manages to locate Kakashi, who is reading his book. Kakashi and Jiraiya take a walk, and Jiraiya explains that he is now returning Naruto to Kakashi's care, and that Naruto must be ready to face the Akatsuki, who are coming out of the shadows and want Naruto due to the Nine-Tailed Fox he has sealed within him. Jiraiya tells Kakashi that he has alerted all of their neighboring allies about the Akatsuki, and that they should prepare themselves. In Suna, Baki tells Gaara that the councll is having a meeting. At the meeting, a Suna shinobi named Yūra explains that Suna has prospered the last few years, having adopted some of Konoha's methods. However, he also brings up the Akatsuki, and how Jiraiya warned him that they would be coming. After the meeting, Yūra clutches in head in pain, albeit dismissing it as a minor headache to a fellow shinobi.\nBack in Konoha, Naruto and Sakura are at the training grounds when Kakashi appears. Naruto and Sakura recall the training grounds as the location of their very first training test, and immediately reminisce on their memories of Team 7, back when Sasuke was on the team. The mere thought and mention of Sasuke bums the two out, but they are snapped out of it by the chime of bells. Kakashi tells them that they would be doing the same test they did the first time they became ninja, to take the bell from Kakashi. Naruto asks whether Kakashi would be reading the whole time, and Sakura adds that he most likely already finished. Kakashi tells them that he has not finished reading, but that he cannot afford to read during this exercise, as both Naruto and Sakura have been trained by a Sannin. Kakashi then raises his forehead protector, as he claims he would need his Sharingan to take on the two at once. The trio are being watched in the shadows by Jiraiya, Tsunade and Shizune, the latter three interested in the outcome of the match.\nIn Sunagakure, two Akatsuki members, Sasori and Deidara, arrive. Their secret agent Yūra manages to murder all of Suna's posted guards, allowing the pair access to the village.",

  "description": "Before Kakashi can officially commence the test, Naruto rushes in to attack. He throws shuriken at Kakashi, only for the latter to throw his own back. As Naruto jumps up into the air to evade the shuriken, Kakashi throws another set. Naruto, however, instantly uses his Shadow Clone Technique to produce a shadow clone in mid-air to pull him out of the shuriken's trajectory. His move impresses both Kakashi and Sakura. As both Naruto and the shadow clone land back on the ground, Naruto transforms his shadow clone into a giant shuriken, intend on hurling it at Kakashi. Kakashi manages to grab Naruto's hand before he can throw it, telling Naruto that his attack would not work. However, Naruto manages to have a shadow clone sneak up on Kakashi with a kunai; his timing and usage of his shadow clones impresses Kakashi once more, as well as Jiraiya, Tsunade and Shizune, who are observing the fight from the shadows. Kakashi tells Naruto that he is impatient as ever, as Naruto also attacked before Kakashi could officially begin during their first bell test. After he begins the match, Kakashi disappears and heads for the woods.\nSasori and Deidara easily enter Sunagakure after Yūra, Sasori's spy, killed the guards posted at the village's entrance. Creating a large clay bird as transportation, Deidara tells Sasori to hang back while he single-handedly proceeds to find the jinchūriki of Shukaku, Gaara. Deidara manages to incapacitate the guards tasked with watching the skies above Sunagakure with his explosive clays, moulded into the shapes of spiders. Deidara marvels at the artistic architecture of Suna, but claims that an explosion is the truest, most beautiful form of art, and therefore he will relish at Suna's destruction.\nBack in Konoha, Kakashi runs through the woods as he spots both Naruto and Sakura hiding behind their trees. He believes it to be a rookie mistake, and reminisces back to their first bell test, when Sakura and Sasuke managed to hide properly but Naruto could not. He is awakened from memory lane by shuriken hurtling towards him, thrown by Naruto. As he evades the attack, Sakura comes from behind and uses her massive strength to break the ground beneath him. Kakashi heads for the tree branches, only for Naruto use his Shadow Clone technique and send multiple shadow clones against him. Kakashi decides to use taijutsu to deal with the clones; however, after there are only three clones remaining, Kakashi opens the First Gate and uses the Front Lotus on the three Naruto shadow clones, both Naruto and Sakura recognising the technique as one Rock Lee uses. After the three shadow clones are taken care of, Kakashi wonders where the real one is, only for the real Naruto to announce his presence and come barrelling at Kakashi with the intent of using One Thousand Years of Death. Kakashi, horrified at the mere thought of being struck by that technique, evades the attack and retreats.\nAs Naruto and Sakura continue to head through the woods to find Kakashi, they are stopped in their tracks by an injured Sasuke. Struck with kunai in his body, Sasuke tells Naruto and Sakura that he managed to escape from Orochimaru and asks the pair to help him. Sakura, however, instantly recognises the trick as a genjutsu and dispels it, while at the same time pinpointing Kakashi's true location. Naruto then creates a shadow clone to prepare his Rasengan, and uses Rasengan on the tree that Kakashi is hiding behind. Kakashi manages to dodge the Rasengan, and ponders on a time when it was easier to fool Sakura with a genjutsu. Naruto claims that he would never fall for any of Kakashi's old tricks, only to spot the bells on the floor. Exclaiming that Kakashi must have dropped them while dodging, Naruto rushes towards them before Sakura can stop him. Naruto is ensnared by a rope before he can get the bells, prompting Kakashi to state that Naruto still falls for the same old tricks. However, the Naruto trapped by the rope turns out to be a shadow clone while the real Naruto, claiming an old trick like that would not work on him, rushes from behind and punches Kakashi right in the face, only for the latter to use a Body Replacement Technique and retreat once more.\nBack in Suna, Deidara believes his infiltration of the village to be successful only to be stopped by Gaara, who claims that this is as far as Deidara gets.",

  "description": "Deidara, riding on his large bird clay, decides to attack Gaara from a distance. Gaara, however, is able to transform the sand into pseudo-Shukaku arms in order to perform long range attacks. As Deidara gets higher up into the air, Gaara uses his sand to create a platform in mid-air. The shinobi of Sunagakure, including Gaara's brother Kankurō, are on the ground witnessing the aerial battle. Deidara resorts to using his explosive clay to target Gaara, only for Gaara to absorb the damage with his sand and then have his sand reform. Deidara then resorts to using a much more powerful variant of his C1. Gaara is able to encase himself in a sand cocoon, while using his Third Eye to maintain his vision. At the same time, he manages to trap Deidara with his Sand Binding Prison technique, which manifests Shukaku's arms to imprison his opponent(s).\nIn Konoha, Naruto and Sakura are still attempting to take the bells from Kakashi. Kakashi manages to predict their moves using his Sharingan and performs hand signs at a speed no human eye can follow, using Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, followed with Earth Release: Double Suicide Decapitation Technique and finishing with Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique. Unable to land a hit on Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura have no choice but to retreat and devise a new strategy. Kakashi also retreats, remarking how his Sharingan is exhausted by Naruto and Sakura's efforts. He contemplates taking the time to finish his Icha Icha book, but remembers that Naruto and Sakura are too tough for him to fight while simultaneously reading.\nNaruto remarks how Kakashi's intelligence exceeds Shikamaru's, how his sense of smell is greater than Kiba's, how his taijutsu surpasses that of Rock Lee's and how his Sharingan is more powerful than Sasuke's. Nonetheless, Sakura states that a great ninja like him must have some sort of a weakness. After deliberating on the thought, Naruto discovers Kakashi's weakness and shares it with Sakura. The pair then track down Kakashi and launch a frontal attack. As they rush towards him, Naruto begins to spoil the ending of Jiraiya's book. Not wanting to hear spoilers, Kakashi covers his ears, but realises his Sharingan can still read Naruto's lips. Exclaiming at Naruto to stop, Kakashi closes his eyes as well, and Naruto and Sakura take the opportunity to take the bells from him, successfully passing the test.",

  "description": "In Konoha, Tsunade is prepared to give Team Kakashi a B-ranked mission. Shizune, however, offers a D-rank mission of walking someone's dog, as she doesn't believe Naruto should go on dangerous missions outside of Konoha as he possesses the Nine-Tailed Fox inside of him. As a compromise, Tsunade decides to give them a C-rank mission of escorting a gold convoy. Naruto returns to his apartment, which is dusty and filled with cobwebs. Glad to be back at home, he dusts off an old picture of Team 7 and tells himself that he will bring Sasuke back home.\nIn Sunagakure, Deidara manages to catch an unconscious Gaara with his clay bird and flies outside of the village. Kankurō chases down the Akatsuki member in an effort to rescue his brother, while Baki orders a Suna shinobi to send word to Konoha. The shinobi sends his message via Takamaru, a carrier bird for the Sand. Back in Konoha, Shikamaru wakes up early to escort Temari to the village's gate, so she can begin her journey back to Suna. Kakashi, who spent the whole night rereading Icha Icha, quickly assembles his team dossier and goes down to meet with Naruto and Sakura, who are to be assigned their first mission as Team Kakashi. After encountering the two, Kakashi notices Takamaru flying above the sky.\nAs Kankurō manages to catch up to the two Akatsuki members, Sasori tells Deidara to go ahead with Gaara while he fights Kankurō. Kankurō attempts to attack a fleeing Deidara using his three puppets; Karasu, Kuroari and Sanshōuo. However, Sasori seems very familiar with Kankurō's techniques, destroying Kuroari and Sanshōuo without breaking a sweat, allowing Deidara to escape.",

  "description": "Baki has the Sunagakure shinobi detonate all the Explosive Tags found in the rubble of the trap Sasori made. Shortly after, a fellow shinobi alerts Baki that Kankurō has been found. Despite not having any serious physical injuries, Kankurō is dying from the poison Sasori injected him with, a toxin unfamiliar to Suna's Medical-nin, meaning they cannot create an antidote. Kankurō tells Baki that the one who attacked him was none other than Suna's very own Sasori of the Red Sand. Baki decides to go visit the Honoured Siblings at the edge of the village and request their help in finding the Akatsuki. One of the honoured siblings, Lady Chiyo, tells Baki that she and her brother have been retired for many years now and have had no connection to the outside world, although she muses that venturing out into the world would mean getting to see her grandson once more. Baki then tells her that her grandson, Sasori, is a member of the Akatsuki who have taken Gaara, and thus by extension Shukaku, into their possession.\nMeanwhile, Naruto, Sakura and Kakashi are heading to Sunagakure, only for Naruto to break formation and rush ahead. On the way, they spot Temari, who is walking back to Suna. Briefing Temari on the situation, she joins them on the trip back to Suna. Naruto continues to rush ahead, and when Sakura attempts to stop him, he tells her that he cannot waste any time. He tells Sakura a secret he suspects she may already know - that he harbours the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox inside of him, a revelation that stuns Temari. He tells them that he and Gaara are the same, as they both have beasts sealed within them and that they both grew up in a very lonely, isolated environment. Naruto states that while he managed to forge bonds with others and emerge out of the darkness, Gaara never did, and thus continued to suffer. Both he and Gaara were detested and feared by the villagers for being monsters, and Naruto adds that the Akatsuki simply view them as the very monsters they have sealed within them. Naruto also reveals that the Akatsuki are after him as well, and tells the group that this time, he won't let Gaara suffer. Temari silently thanks Naruto for his actions, while Sakura reveals that she knows about Itachi. She tells Naruto that during her two years of training with Tsunade, she often read reports and therefore is aware that Itachi is a member of the Akatsuki and that Itachi is the very person who Sasuke wants to kill. Sakura theorises that Sasuke only went to Orochimaru to quench his thirst for power, while also revealing that she is aware that Orochimaru only wants Sasuke for a vessel and that Orochimaru has six months left before he needs a new body. Knowing that one day Itachi would face both Naruto and Sasuke, Sakura vows to be there as well to protect them for once, as they have done for her.",

  "description": "Deidara and Sasori arrive at the Akatsuki hideout. The Akatsuki leader gathers the other members using an astral projection technique, and they begin a three-day long technique to extract the One-Tailed Shukaku from Gaara and seal it in a giant statue. The leader orders Zetsu to use his physical body to guard the entrance to the hideout while they begin extracting Shukaku.\nAs she is doing her work in her office, one of Tsunade's coffee mugs crack, which she considers a bad omen. After finding out that she has won the lottery, she considers that an even worse omen and has Shizune locate Team Guy, who have just returned from another mission. Tsunade and Shizune send them to Sunagakure to provide backup to Team Kakashi. Despite Suna being three days away from Konoha, Guy is confident that his team will get there in one day, while Lee claims they could make the trip in half a day.\nIn Sunagakure, Chiyo and Ebizo come out of retirement and return to the village, in order for Chiyo to assess Kankurō's wounds. Despite attempting a few antidotes, she is unable to cure Kankurō of his ailment and admits that the only person who may be able to heal him is the Slug Princess, Tsunade of Konohagakure. Baki tells her that Tsunade is now Hokage of Konoha, and that she cannot drop everything and come to Suna, adding that even if she did, Konoha was three days away while Kankurō has only a day to live. Despite this, he tells Chiyo that they have sent word to Konoha asking for their help. Chiyo is disgusted, claiming that Suna is not a prosperous nation due to their reliance and dependence on neighbouring lands like Konoha, and states that if Suna taught and prepared their shinobi properly, there would be no need to ask another village for their help. She finds the mere idea pathetic, and leaves the room to go rest outside.\nMeanwhile, Naruto, Kakashi, Temari and Sakura are on the way to Suna, but get delayed by a sandstorm. Once the storm subsides, they rush to the village, where the four are briefed by Suna shinobi regarding Kankurō's status. Sakura tells Temari not to worry as she will check up on Kankurō. As they reach the hospital, Sakura and Temari rush in to Kankurō's side, while Chiyo gasps as she spots Kakashi, whom she believes is the infamous White Fang of Konoha. Rushing at Kakashi, she tells him to defend himself or prepare for death.",

  "description": "The battle between Guy and Kisame intensifies. Guy brings out his nunchaku to compensate for Kisame's Samehada sword, but is unable to land a strike. Kisame uses his Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique to force Guy underwater, and follows up with his Water Release: Five Feeding Sharks technique. Guy uses his taijutsu to attack all five sharks, but the sharks use the water to regenerate from their injuries. As his team is reaching the end of their line in their water prison and unable to take down Kisame himself, Guy resorts to using the Eight Gates. Opening the first six gates, Guy is able to stand on the ocean floor, recover from his wounds and send all the water flying upwards. Neji uses the opportunity to emit chakra from his body, breaking out of his water prison. He then uses Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on the three Kisame water clones, freeing his team. Guy assumes his Morning Peacock stance, ready to defeat Kisame.\nMeanwhile, Naruto realises that he's in a genjutsu that Itachi cast upon him when the various Itachi he strikes transform into crows. Naruto wonders how Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu when he did not even look at his eyes, and Itachi states that he can cast genjutsu with his ring, which Naruto looked at. Itachi then prepares to put Naruto to sleep. Remembering Jiraiya's training regarding how to break out of a genjutsu, Naruto dispels the crows Itachi conjures, causing Itachi to remark that Naruto has grown.",

  "description": "Unable to escape from the visions that Itachi placed on him, Naruto mentally pleads with Sakura or Kakashi to free him from the genjutsu. He is then released by Sakura and Chiyo. Kakashi tells Naruto to stay alert, while he rushes towards Itachi. Itachi uses Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique, which Kakashi is able to zip through and avoid. Itachi launches his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique at Naruto, Sakura and Chiyo, and all three manage to avoid its path. Kakashi attempts to hit Itachi with his Lightning Cutter, but Itachi is able to jump into the air and evade the attack. However, Naruto attempts to hit Itachi in mid-air with his Rasengan. As Naruto makes contact, it turns out that that Itachi is a shadow clone. Kakashi uses the Hiding in Mist Technique that he copied from Zabuza years ago to shroud the environment. Itachi claims it useless as his Sharingan can still see through the mist, and attempts to hit Kakashi with his Fireball Technique. Kakashi muses that something is off about Itachi, and goes under the ground in an attempt to use Earth Release: Double Suicide Decapitation Technique, but Itachi manages to avoid Kakashi's attack. Holding Kakashi in place, Itachi attempts to cast a genjutsu on Kakashi. The Kakashi in his grip, however, is a shadow clone, that now has a hold on Itachi. Kakashi tells Naruto to hit both his shadow clone and Kakashi. Since Itachi was able to counter his Rasengan, Naruto recalls his training with Jiraiya, in which Jiraiya reminds him that Rasengan is a jutsu created by the Fourth Hokage, and that Naruto should use his unique chakra to improve and create his own unique Rasengan, which would be the most powerful technique in his arsenal. Naruto decides now is a good time to use it, and thus, using a shadow clone, rushes at Itachi and the Kakashi shadow clone with his Big Ball Rasengan. The attack hits Itachi, but Itachi smirks at Naruto right as he is hit. Sakura and Chiyo marvel at the destructive power of Naruto's technique.\nAfter the technique subsides, the four are surprised to see that the dead body in front of them is not that of Itachi's, but of Yūra, an Anbu Commander and a Jōnin from Sunagakure. After Guy uses his Morning Peacock to destroy Kisame, Team Guy is surprised that the corpse lying in front of them is not that of Kisame's, but that of a stranger dressed in the Akatsuki cloak. Guy reaffirms his original feeling that he has never met the man lying in front of them before.",

  "description": "Team Kakashi and Team Guy are both able to come to the conclusion that the fight they had was nothing more than a distraction to prevent them from rescuing Gaara. Chiyo summons a Mechanical Bird to deliver a message to her brother Ebizō regarding Yūra, the man used as a sacrifice for Itachi. Chiyo explains that for the Akatsuki to use such a technique would mean that they have already begun the extraction. When Sakura asks what she means, Chiyo explains that the tailed beasts were often harnessed for their power by sealing them inside individuals. Those individuals would become host to the beast itself and would be able to keep the beast sealed within them while using the beast's power for themselves. Those individuals, known as jinchūriki, would however die if the beast was extracted from them. Chiyo explains that before Gaara, Sunagakure had two jinchūriki who had Shukaku sealed within them, and they died following the extraction. Sakura is angry that shinobi harnessed the power of the beasts during the war and is about to criticise the jinchūriki who were created, before stopping herself short when she realises that Naruto is a jinchūriki himself. Tearful at the idea of the Akatsuki killing Naruto by extracting the Nine-Tailed Fox out of him, Sakura is about to talk to Naruto when Naruto interrupts, telling them that they should be on the move if they expect to save Gaara.\nIn Suna, Kankurō stumbles out of bed when he hears that Chiyo has sent a message. He and Baki head to a Suna Council meeting, where it's revealed that Yura was indeed an Akatsuki spy, thus explaining how Sasori and Deidara got into the village undetected. Not wanting to wait for Gaara to return, the council deliberates on choosing a new Kazekage. Kankurō and Baki are appalled, stating that there is nothing that proves that Gaara will not return. A councilman, however, states that Gaara being gone is perhaps best for the village, since most of the village is fearful that the One-Tail Shukaku spirit within Gaara will be unleashed upon them. The council men decide that electing a new Kazekage would bring much needed stability to the village. Kankurō protests, but he is told that once before, the Third Kazekage, the strongest Kazekage Suna ever had, was also kidnapped. Suna had sent many recovery teams to locate him, but they could not even locate his corpse. To make matters worse, neighbouring nations attacked their village when it became known that the Kazekage was no more. Wanting to avoid a war and believing that it is best not to have Gaara in the village, the councilman decides a new Kazekage should be the best course of action. Kankurō tells the Council that while he agrees with their points, he still cannot write off Gaara's fate since Gaara is his little brother.\nKakashi notices that Naruto's pace has slowed down considerably, realising that he must be wiped out from using his Big Ball Rasengan. Kakashi calls for a break, which Chiyo calls a wise decision. Naruto protests, but Kakashi explains that if they were to rest up and then continue, they would reach Gaara much faster than if they continued at their current pace. Kakashi also adds that Naruto would have to be at his full strength in the event that he faces those who kidnapped Gaara. Meanwhile, Pakkun notices that Guy is in pain, due to the toll of opening the sixth gate. Lee asks him if he is okay, but Guy crashes into a tree branch and is knocked out. Neji decides that Guy deserves some rest after using the Morning Peacock, and they decide to take a break as well.\nBack at the Akatsuki hideout, the Akatsuki leader commends Itachi and Kisame for stalling the enemy. Sasori believes that he should be praised as well, since it was his two subordinates that were used as sacrifice for the leader's technique. The leader claims that it his technique that did the trick and that his two subordinates should be thankful for the opportunity to serve the Akatsuki, albeit a very brief opportunity. The leader then asks for a status report from Itachi. Itachi states that the Konoha shinobi were none another than Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno and the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Fox, Naruto Uzumaki, along with Suna shinobi Lady Chiyo. Sasori is surprised to hear that his grandmother is on their pursuit. The leader of the Akatsuki then orders Zetsu to find the corpses of the sacrifices and to dispose of them.",

  "description": "Team Guy and Team Kakashi both finish resting up and go back to pursuing Gaara. Neji notices that there is no one in their vicinity, meaning that their enemies are confident that they have been successfully delayed, which he finds uncomfortable. Chiyo and Kakashi come to the same conclusion as well. Naruto's anger and frustration causes him to slightly tap into the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, causing his whiskers to become more prominent, changing his eyes from blue to red and increasing his stamina. Chiyo asks Kakashi why Naruto is so keen on rescuing Gaara when they're not even from the same village. Kakashi explains that Naruto is also a jinchūriki, that he harbors the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Fox within him. Kakashi tells her that since all jinchūriki are treated the same no matter what village they're raised in, Naruto understands the pain Gaara suffered through, and therefore he wishes to save Gaara from any more pain and suffering. Chiyo is surprised at this, and tells Kakashi that at her old age, she thought she knew how the world worked. She believed people only looked out of themselves and that alliances with neighbouring lands were nothing more than a farce. Wanting only to do what was best for Sunagakure, Chiyo tells Kakashi that it was she, with the permission of the Fourth Kazekage, who sealed Shukaku inside of Gaara. Despite being an old woman, she believes that perhaps there is still something she could do for the good of the village.\nMeanwhile, the Akatsuki finish sealing Shukaku inside of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. The extraction kills Gaara, who in his last moments contemplates on the nature of his existence. Deidara states that the entire process took three days. Gaara's dead body falls the floor, and Deidara and Sasori prepare to deal with the intruders headed their way. Outside of the hideout, Team Guy arrive. Lee decides to break their way in, but Guy notices the barrier seal. At the same time, Team Kakashi arrive. Lee is ecstatic to see Naruto and Sakura once more, but Naruto, still under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra, is too agitated and restless to have a reunion. Guy and Kakashi then decide to work together to find a way inside the base.",

  "description": "Neji uses his Byakugan to see inside the hideout but is unable to locate Gaara, due to Naruto constantly jerking him around. However, he manages to get a glimpse of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, though he is unable to explain what exactly it is. Guy attempts to break the boulder blocking their path, but is unable to so due to the barrier seal on the boulder. Kakashi theorises that the Akatsuki must have used a Five-Seal Barrier. He explains that there are four other tags in the vicinity and that all five tags must be ripped off at the same time to deactivate the barrier. Using his Byakugan, Neji locates all the other tags, and using wireless headsets, Team Guy sets off to find the four barrier seals. Meanwhile, most of the Akatsuki members end their astral projection technique and leave the hideout. Deidara and Sasori, who are the only members to be physically present, are ordered by the Akatsuki leader to dispose of the intruders. However, he tells them that the Nine-Tails' Jinchūriki is to be captured alive. Although Naruto's capture was a task personally assigned to Itachi, Sasori is now given that responsibility. Itachi tells Sasori that Naruto is the one who rushes in and barks first. With that, Itachi and Kisame end their astral projection. The leader tells them that he expects results, and he too leaves. Deidara and Sasori then sit there waiting for their intruders to come to them.\nOn the outside, Team Guy locates the four tags. Kakashi rips off the one by the boulder at the same time that Team Guy rips off their seals, causing the barrier to break. Sakura uses her Chakra Enhanced Strength to shatter the boulder. With the entrance now open, the Kazekage Rescue Team use the Button Hook Entry to sneak in, although they are immediately greeted by Deidara and Sasori, who are sitting on Gaara's corpse. This infuriates Naruto to tap into the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, causing his eyes to change from blue to red and for his whiskers to be defined more prominently. Sasori and Deidara realise that he is the jinchūriki that they must capture. Meanwhile, sudden blobs began to form in front of the respective members of Team Guy.",

  "description": "Naruto chases after Deidara, unaware that Deidara is baiting him. However, Kakashi also tags along, telling Sakura and Chiyo to handle Sasori until Team Guy manages to return. Wanting to fight Naruto alone, Deidara tells Kakashi that Sasori is much stronger than him, and therefore he should go back in order to aid Sakura and Chiyo. Naruto agrees, but Kakashi remains. Kakashi decides to use his Sharingan against Deidara since the latter managed to defeat Gaara, who was a Kage. Deidara finds Naruto's behaviour odd, stating that with the exception of Gaara, they have killed two Jinchūriki before, and that no one came to their rescue; he adds that most people were actually glad to be rid of them. He understands that Naruto must have some desire to save another of his kind, but finds the notion pathetic.\nBack inside the Akatsuki hideout, Chiyo explains that the Sasori they see in front of them is not Sasori's actual body, but in fact a puppet named Hiruko. Sakura wonders where Sasori is, as she does not see someone behind Hiruko pulling his strings, and is shocked to learn that Sasori is operating Hiruko from within. Chiyo explains that since puppet masters are not good at close combat and rely on their puppets to attack, this leaves the puppeteers themselves vulnerable, hence why Sasori created Hiruko, to counteract that weakness. Chiyo reveals that Sasori was once a master puppeteer in Sunagakure, but at some point began to transform human corpses into human puppets, which Sasori considered a form of art. The puppet they see in front of them, Hiruko, is actually the body of a shinobi from a neighbouring village whose corpse Sasori used. Chiyo tells Sakura that she joined the Kazekage Rescue Team believing she could stop Sasori, as she knew how Hiruko operated, but reveals that Sasori has improved and refined the puppet. Nonetheless, they believe they have the advantage and Chiyo shares a secret with Sakura, which Sasori is unable to hear.\nFinally ready to start their battle, Chiyo and Sakura rush at Sasori/Hiruko. Sasori uses Prepared Puppet: Eight Waves of Needles, which causes poison-laced senbon to rapidly fire out of Hiruko's mouth. Both Chiyo and Sakura are able to dodge every single senbon. Sasori resorts to releasing Hiruko's arm and launching it as a projectile, which releases even more poison-laced senbon. Once more, Chiyo and Sakura are able to avoid every single one of them, to Sasori's disbelief. While he is able to understand Chiyo's masterful dodging, as she is an expert puppeteer herself, he is unable to comprehend how Sakura was able to do so as well. While Chiyo stands idly, Sakura rushes towards Hiruko. Sasori attempts to jab her using Hiruko's poison-tipped tail but his attack is blocked by Chiyo, leaving Hiruko vulnerable. Using her Chakra Enhanced Strength, Sakura lands a massive blow on Hiruko, destroying the human puppet. Sasori manages to get out of the rubble, but keeps his face covered. Chiyo demands that he turn around and face them, claiming she waited 20 years and travelled all this way just to see her grandson's face once more.",

  "description": "With his puppet destroyed, Sasori reveals himself to Chiyo and Sakura, looking no older than when he left his village over twenty years ago. Chiyo and Sakura are both unable to believe that Sasori has not aged in two decades. Meanwhile, Temari's team, along with Kankurō and Ebizō, decide to make their way towards the Land of Rivers, in order to support the Kazekage Rescue Team. Kankurō tells Temari to take a break, which Temari protests, until Kankurō points out the members of her team are exhausted and unable to continue. Although Temari is able to persuade them to push themselves past their limits in order to save their Kazekage, Ebizō tells the others to take notice of where they have stopped. Looking around, the team realise that they are standing on the same battlefield where Team Kakashi fought Itachi. Ebizō claims that since they are in Akatsuki territory, blindly rushing in, and to do so exhausted, would result in swift and sudden annihilation. While the team decides to rest, Ebizō tells them the tale of the strongest ninja in Sunagakure's history, the Third Kazekage, and how one day he was mysteriously kidnapped. He tells the Suna ninja that the village searched for him for years, with the Anbu even searching in secret. However, they were unable to find his corpse or even how he was kidnapped. Ebizō states that during the time that Suna searched for the Third Kazekage, the village entered into a state of panic that allowed enemy ninja from a rival village to invade Suna and cause a war. Believing that such bloodshed could have been avoided had Suna dealt with the crisis in a calm fashion, Ebizō tells the team not to repeat Suna's mistakes from the days of the Third Kazekage.\nBack in the Akatsuki hideout, Sasori uses Hiruko's head to launch another round of poison-tipped senbon, only for Sakura to dodge them all once more. However, this time he realises that it is Chiyo who is pulling the strings, using Sakura as her own human puppet. He then summons a new puppet to battle with, revealed to be none other than the Third Kazekage. Chiyo realises that it is Sasori who kidnapped and killed the Third around a decade ago, and is appalled to learn that he transformed the Third into a human puppet. While she finds his association with Akatsuki regrettable, she finds his betrayal to his village the most despicable, holding him responsible for the murders of the last three Kazekage - the Third, the fourth, and Gaara, the Fifth, despite Orochimaru killing the Fourth. Sasori claims that it was one of his spies that was complicit in the murder of the Fourth, but admits that the Akatsuki and Orochimaru have some shared history. Wanting some answers, Sakura tells Sasori that he will tell her what she wants to know. Not wanting to drag out their fight, as he needs to aid Deidara outside capture Naruto, Sasori uses the Third Kazekage puppet to launch more poison senbon towards Sakura; Chiyo manages to have Sakura evade the attack successfully. Using the Third Kazekage's poison blades, Sasori tries to stab Sakura, but the attack is blocked by Hiruko's tail, which Chiyo controls with her chakra threads. However, the blades are powerful enough to break Hiruko's already powerful tail. Having no other method to protect Sakura, Chiyo is unable to block Sasori's Thousand Hands Manipulation Force. However, she is able to masterfully control Sakura to avoid any damage and pull her out of harm's way. Sasori counters by releasing poison gas, knowing that despite Chiyo controlling Sakura, there is no way she could prevent Sakura from inhaling the fumes.\nOn the outside, Deidara flies away with Gaara's corpse, prompting Naruto to follow him. Since Team Guy is occupied and Deidara was strong enough to beat Gaara, Kakashi decides to follow Naruto, leaving Sakura and Chiyo to defeat Sasori on their own.",

  "description": "Naruto continues to follow Deidara, who considers himself lucky that will have taken down not one but two jinchūriki. Only wanting to take on Naruto, he attempts to ditch Kakashi using his Explosive Clay, but Kakashi prevails. As his supply of clay is running low, he realises that he must face Kakashi along with Naruto at the same time. Kakashi continues to follow as he is already too far from the others, even noting that he is about to be out of range of the wireless radio's transmission.\nSakura manages to escape the poison gas cloud by using an explosive tag, the blast dissipating the gas. She tells Sasori that he will be taken down by her, but Sasori responds by sending multiple kunai her way. Chiyo blocks the move by using the \"Mother\" and \"Father\" puppets, that Sasori had modelled out of his dead parents as a child. Sasori finds the idea absurd, as he designed those puppets and knows how they work. Nonetheless, Chiyo has the Mother and Father puppets pull out wire string and have them charge at Sasori. The puppets manage to slice through the Third Kazekage puppet's Thousand Hands Manipulation Force. Sasori detaches the left arm of the puppet before Chiyo's could slice through them. The left arm is revealed to have a buzzsaw, but the Mother and Father puppets have hidden weapons of their own. After going through an intense puppet battle, Chiyo manages to destroy the buzzsaw while Sasori destroys the Mother's sword and the Father's club. Deciding to use his trump card, Sasori unveils the Third Kazekage's secret technique: Iron Sand, touted to be the most dangerous technique in Sunagakure history.\nMeanwhile, Team Guy are having trouble fighting their clones, exhausted from their efforts and no one except Guy being able to land a blow on their counterparts.",

  "description": "The Third Kazekage, being a human puppet, was built to retain the chakra the body once had when it was alive, allowing the Third to use his special Iron Sand techniques. Sasori unleashes the Third's Iron Sand Drizzle, which Chiyo blocks using the \"Mother\" and \"Father\" puppets' chakra shield that she had installed. While the Father puppet used the chakra shield to block the Iron Sand, the Mother puppet simply pushed Sakura out of the way. However, the Iron Sand creeps into the Father puppet's joints, rendering it useless. Since there is only one puppet left, Sasori tells Chiyo that she can either defend herself or Sakura, but not both. He then executes the technique again, and Chiyo uses the Mother's chakra shield to save Sakura; she manages to save herself by using the chakra shield she installed in her right arm, which is revealed to be a prosthetic puppet arm. Sasori is surprised that she rigged her own body, and claims that all great puppet masters must think alike. Chiyo then realises that the reason Sasori retains his youthful look is because he too must have rigged his own body.\nChiyo remembers back to when Sasori's parents were killed by the White Fang of Konoha, leaving her to raise Sasori herself. Deciding to pass down the Puppet Technique to Sasori, she recalls when he managed to recreate his parents through puppets in order to feel the parental love he never got. In the present, Sasori forms the Iron Sand into high density shapes. Having no more puppets left, Chiyo is left to fend for herself as she tells Sakura to flee while she still can. Sakura, however, offered herself as a puppet for Chiyo to use. Despite the fact that Chiyo now only has one arm left to use her chakra threads, she is still able to help move Sakura out of the way of the Iron Sand in order for Sakura to use her Chakra Enhanced Strength in an attempt to take down Sasori.",

  "description": "Sasori has formed the Iron Sand into a giant pyramid and rectangular prism, which he uses it to attack Sakura. Recalling her training with Tsunade, in which the Slug Princess taught her to evade an enemy's attacks and read their movements, Sakura is able to anticipate Sasori's movements, impressing Chiyo, and the former uses her Chakra Enhanced Strength to punch and kick the pyramid and rectangular prism around the cave. This causes the entire roof of the hideout to collapse. Impressed by Sakura's strength and realising she could continue to repel his attacks, Sasori decides to expend more of the Third Kazekage puppet's chakra by creating more Iron Sand, which he manipulates into a gigantic sphere of branching spikes. Sakura finds herself unable to block or evade the attack, and is helpless as the attack rains down on her. Although she manages to avoid severe physical injury, it turns out Sasori had infused the Iron Sand with his special brand of poison, and that the Iron Sand's branches managed to cut Sakura; she collapses due to the poison. Sasori states that while Sakura would die in three days if left alone, he would rather finish her off right now. Revealing a blade hidden within the Third Kazekage puppet, he sends it towards Sakura to personally finish her off, only for Sakura to leap up and destroy the entire puppet in a single punch.\nOutside the cave, Team Guy continues to fight their clones, though to no avail. All of them notice the rumbling around them, and Neji notifies them that the hide-out is collapsing; Lee praises Sakura's ability to hold her own. Elsewhere, Kakashi notices the sound of the cave-in, but is out of range of everyone else and continues to follow Naruto, who is pursuing Deidara.",

  "description": "Sakura manages to destroy the Third Kazekage puppet using her Chakra Enhanced Strength. She then uses the strength to lift a boulder off of Chiyo's remaining arm and uses her medical ninja expertise to heal the damage. Sasori wonders how Sakura is able to move, and remembers when he left Kankurō alive to die from the poison. He wonders whether anybody from Sunagakure could have analysed the poison and made an antidote but claims that not even Chiyo would have been able to do it. However, upon watching Sakura heal Chiyo, he remembers that she is from Konohagakure, a nation led by the world's most renown medic-nin, Tsunade. Realising she cooked the antidote and not wanting to risk losing any more human puppets, Sasori disrobes and reveals the secret to his eternal youth - that he himself is a puppet. Having equipped himself with various weapons along with his special brand of poison, he launches his attack against Sakura and Chiyo.\nOutside, Naruto is still angrily chasing Deidara. Deidara believes that Sasori will berate him from dragging the situation out, and needing to get rid of Kakashi, he forms crickets out of his explosive clay to kill Kakashi. He manages to separate Kakashi and Naruto, but Kakashi creates a shadow clone that bears the brunt of the detonation caused by the crickets. Deidara believes Kakashi to be dead and halts his flight, ready to engage Naruto, only for Kakashi to show up. Deidara flees once more, but before Naruto can continue his pursuit, Kakashi stops him. He tells Naruto that he is a close-combat fighter while Deidara is a long-range fighter. To top it off, Deidara infiltrated Suna and took out Gaara all on his own. Kakashi tells Naruto that the only way he could beat Deidara is if he had a long-range fighting specialist on his team, long-range ninjutsu or the intelligence of someone like Shikamaru. As Kakashi fits under all three categories, Kakashi devises a strategy for the duo to defeat Deidara together. As they resume tailing Deidara, the latter spots Kakashi in tow preparing and closing his Sharingan.",

  "description": "Sakura and Chiyo continue their battle with Sasori, who is using flamethrowers on the rocks the pair are hiding behind. Chiyo attempts to attack Sasori using the head of the Third Kazekage puppet, but Sasori incinerates it. Sasori switches tactics and uses his Water Stream Shooters to destroy the rocks and the surrounding environment. Using the poison stinger attached to the coiled rope from his puppet body, Sasori attempts to stab them, but Sakura, who is still under the effects of the antidote, grabs the poisoned coiled rope and uses her strength to pull it. Sasori deems the action useless and charges at Chiyo, spinning the propeller blades attached to his body at a high speed. Before he can decimate Chiyo, Sakura manages to pull all of the rope, halting his attack and sending him flying towards her. Using her Chakra Enhanced Strength, she is able to shatter the puppet, sending his core of living flesh out of the body. Sakura believes the battle to be won and runs towards Chiyo, but the core reinserts itself into Sasori's puppet body, which is then reassembled.\nSeeing this, Chiyo uses the White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets, summoning the ten puppets created by the first Puppet Master Monzaemon Chikamatsu. Chiyo refers to the technique as her trump card, as it takes veritable skill controlling ten puppets at once and only uses the technique in a life-or-death situation. Sasori commends the move, expecting no less from his esteemed grandmother; however, he counters with his Red Secret Technique: Performance of a Hundred Puppets, summoning one hundred puppets. Sakura uses her strength to fight Sasori's puppets and Chiyo does the same with the help of her Ten Puppets, showcasing that quality exceeds quantity, as Chiyo's ten puppets are far stronger than Sasori's one hundred. Chiyo and Sakura seem to trap and defeat Sasori using Sealing Technique: Lion Closing Roar, but, under the cover of battle, Sasori secretly transfers the only living part of his body — his core — into another puppet. Sakura once more believes the battle to be won and runs towards Chiyo, this time to heal the latter with the antidote, as she had been struck with poison during the blade. Sasori rushes towards Chiyo with a poison-tipped sword, intent on killing his grandmother, but Sakura uses herself as a shield and is stabbed in her torso.",

  "description": "Sakura is unable to heal her wounds as the sword in her torso is laced with poison, shutting her system down. Although she has been poisoned as well, albeit at a lesser degree, Chiyo uses the antidote on Sakura, causing the latter to regain her strength. Revealing another blade hidden in the joint of his puppet, Sasori detaches himself from the sword and takes a leap backwards, prompting to rush forward to finish off Sakura. Chiyo manages to block his move by stabbing him through his core using the \"Father\" and \"Mother\" puppets. With Sasori immobilised, Chiyo revives the nearly-dead Sakura using her reincarnation ninjutsu. Chiyo explains that the technique takes the user's life force and transfers it to another, reanimating them at the cost of the user's own life. However, because Sakura was not dead yet, Chiyo does not die from using the technique. Sasori wonders why Chiyo and Sakura would give their lives for one another, stating that he has no regard for human life himself, having claimed the lives of thousands of people. Chiyo places the blame of his mentality on the upbringing of those raised in Sunagakure, where shinobi are taught to only focus on themselves and not anybody else. At full strength once more, Sakura punches Sasori, but he tells her that he cannot feel pain, as he is a puppet, and wonders why Sakura and Chiyo tend to do pointless things. However, he decides to do something pointless as well, and as a reward for defeating them he reveals that he had a meeting with one of his spies, who works for Orochimaru, next week at the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure. He tells Sakura that he doesn't think he will make it to their rendez-vous, but dies before finishing his sentence. Sakura is glad that their battle is over, but Chiyo tells her that she was the one who should have died, explaining that Sasori was always able to read her movements, and therefore he knew her attack was coming, yet for some reason he couldn't dodge her final attack, saying he was off guard for a moment.\nMeanwhile, Naruto and Kakashi continue pursuing Deidara. Naruto asks whether Kakashi has prepared his long-range technique yet, and Kakashi reveals his Mangekyō Sharingan.",

However, because the clones still exist, Neji theorises that perhaps it must have been Deidara who cast the jutsu, although he also adds the possibility that even if the caster is defeated, the jutsu will still continue.\nBack in the cave, Sakura heads to the exit to the cave as Chiyo collapses, due to the poison in her system. Having no more antidote on her, she tells Chiyo that they should rush back to Sunagakure, where she will send a request to Konoha to send her the materials she needs to make more antidote. Chiyo, however, does not wish to return yet, as she believes she has not finished with her duty yet.\nOutside, Naruto and Kakashi continue to pursue Deidara, the latter now wielding his Mangekyō Sharingan. Naruto tells Kakashi that even his newfound Sharingan technique does not work, he himself will find a way to defeat Deidara. Meanwhile, Team Guy continues to fight their clones, although they get beaten as their clones seem stronger. Neji tells them that the clones have not gotten stronger, but that they have gotten weaker. Since they are of flesh and blood, they can get tired and exhausted, but the clones have no such drawbacks. Lee, however, theorises that since the clones maintain the exact same level of strength as they had the moment they ripped off the seals, then they would simply need to be stronger than they were then. Tenten finds the idea of gaining extra strength in a short time ludicrous, but Lee recalls back to their training days, where their team motto was to be stronger than they were yesterday. Lee tells them that his own personal credo is to be stronger than he was a minute ago, and manages to use Youth Full Power to defeat his clone. Tenten uses Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain Disaster, which is a stronger version of her Twin Rising Dragons technique, to impale her clone; Guy uses Leaf Great Flash to take down his clone; and Neji uses Eight Trigrams Mountain Crusher, which is a stronger version of his Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm, to send his clone flying through a boulder, defeating it.",

Supporting Chiyo, Sakura continues to follow their trail, recalling Naruto's anger at Deidara when the latter sat on Gaara's body and declared that the Kazekage was dead.\nNaruto and Kakashi continue to pursue Deidara, who is flying above them on his giant clay bird. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan's inter-dimensional warping technique, Kamui, Kakashi attempts to force Deidara into a vortex. He struggles with using a jutsu of this magnitude and is unable to kill Deidara, but manages to warp and rip his right arm off. Having no arms left, as his left arm was crushed and removed by Gaara's Sand Binding Coffin during their fight, Deidara attempts to flee. Kakashi attempts to use Kamui again, but Deidara is able to fly and avoid being sucked in once more. Kakashi is exhausted from using his Mangekyō Sharingan and is forced to stop and rest. Seeing this, Deidara believes he has successfully escaped and lets down his guard, only for Naruto and his shadow clone to rush at Deidara in mid-air with Rasengan. Deidara leaps out of the way, but Naruto's Rasengan manages to hit his clay bird, tearing it in two. Creating two more shadow clones, Naruto catches the front part of the bird and pries Gaara's body out its mouth. He pleads with Gaara to wake up, but finally realises in anguish that Gaara is dead.\nHaving defeated their clones, Team Guy sets off to provide backup for Team Kakashi. Guy attempts to communicate using their wireless radio, but is out of range. He asks Neji to spot them, and the latter uses his Byakugan to report that Naruto and Kakashi have successfully rescued Gaara, although he then notices that Gaara is dead.\nAngered that the Akatsuki have claimed Gaara's life, Naruto vows to avenge his friend. Deidara tells Naruto that perhaps they will face off sometime in the future. Kakashi alerts Deidara that he has let his guard down once more, and the real Naruto, under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra, appears behind Deidara and punches him the ground. Creating more shadow clones, the clones each grab on to one of Deidara's limbs as the Akatsuki member crashes on to the hard ground, landing on his back. Naruto then leaps from the tree and lands forcefully on Deidara himself, and proceeds to pummel Deidara's face until Naruto's knuckles are bloodied. Wanting to kill Deidara, Naruto prepares his Rasengan and drives it into Deidara's stomach. Deidara manages to use Body Replacement Technique, avoiding the damage. Full of hatred towards Deidara and anger towards Gaara's death, Naruto begins to draw out more of the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, causing the red chakra to envelop around Naruto and forming a red chakra tail, transforming the jinchūriki into his One-Tailed form.",

  "description": "Naruto begins to shroud himself with the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, entering his Version 1 form, sprouting a single chakra tail. He attempts to locate Deidara, but to no avail. Kakashi recalls Jiraiya warning him about Naruto's \"Nine-Tailed Cloak Form\", telling him to stop the transformation before Naruto grows a second tail. In order to halt the transformation, he gave Kakashi a seal that would suppress all the chakra in Naruto's body. Naruto then begins to grow a second tail, the additional chakra causing his shadow clones to feel a burning sensation, with the shadow clone near Kakashi dispelling itseld out of pain. Naruto rushes towards the woods, destroying the trees in his vicinity. Kakashi leaps down and attempts to calm him down, only for Naruto launch an attack at Kakashi. Kakashi dodges it and stamps the seal on Naruto's forehead protector, shutting down his chakra and reverting him back to normal.\nAs Naruto's transformation subsides, Sakura and Chiyo arrive, where the pair announce that Sasori has been dealt with. Surprised that the two kunoichi killed Sasori, Deidara attempts to slither out of the bush he is hiding in and to escape, only for his path to be blocked by Team Guy, who had used Neji's Byakugan to locate him. Deidara is impressed with the Hyūga Clan's kekkei genkai, wondering how it compares against the Uchiha Clan's Sharingan, but adds that he does not have the time to stick around and find out. Team Guy attempts to stop his escape; despite having no arms, Deidara swiftly dodges Tenten, Guy and Lee. Neji, however, manages to hit with his Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm. Deidara survives the attack and heads towards the body of his giant clay bird, using his teeth to bite off a chunk of the clay and converting it to explosive clay using his mouth. Deidara then swells up and seemingly self-detonates; Team Guy attempts to escape the blast radius, but the range of the explosion is too big. However, the explosion is countered by Kakashi's Kamui, which is able to warp it to a different dimension just in time, although the usage of his Mangekyō Sharingan causes Kakashi to collapse.\nNaruto's shadow clones, carrying Gaara's body, regroup with the others. Naruto asks Sakura if there is anything she could do to save Gaara, still clinging on to the hope that he may be resuscitated. Sakura attempts to do so, but fails. Naruto cries out in anger over Gaara having being killed despite just recently reaching his dream of being Kazekage. He begins to weep, claiming that he was not able to save Sasuke and despite training for three years, he was unable to save Gaara. When Chiyo tells him to calm down, he lashes out of her, blaming her and the rest of Sunagakure for sealing Shukaku inside Gaara. He holds them responsible as they did not take Gaara's feelings or life into consideration, and detests them to sealing tailed beasts inside of people to create jinchūriki, claiming that they had no right to alter that person's life or fate in anyway whatsoever. Naruto's words cut deep wounds for Chiyo, as she was the one who sealed Shukaku inside of Gaara. Wanting to atone for her past, she decides to resurrect Gaara at the cost of her own life.",

  "description": "Chiyo begins using her reincarnation ninjutsu on Gaara, to make amends for her past. Naruto attempts to interfere, but is stopped by Sakura, who tells him that she is bringing him back from the dead. Neji believes that such a convenient jutsu must come at a personal cost, a thought shared by Kakashi. Chiyo is unable to successfully resurrect Gaara, due to her low chakra levels. Naruto, however, offers his own chakra. Chiyo recalls Kakashi's remarks on Naruto; a jinchūriki like Gaara, he is the only one who understands Gaara's pain and suffering, hence his intense desire to save Gaara. Using Naruto's chakra to supplement her technique, she tells him that his power to make friends with anyone will result in him being a Hokage the world has yet to see the likes of; she also tells Sakura that one day she will surpass Tsunade. Chiyo hopes for a brighter future for both Sunagakure and Konohagakure, a future where both Naruto and Gaara will make sure that the world is not like how it was in Chiyo's time. She remarks that everything she has done for Suna her whole life has been wrong, and that resurrecting Gaara is the only thing she has done right.\nGaara's spirit returns to his body, as he sees himself as a younger child crying all alone. However, he is surprised when he sees and feels a young Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him. As he opens his eyes, he is shocked to find himself in the real world with Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him, the latter glad to see Gaara once more. Gaara notices that nearly every member of Suna's military are also there, all of them cheering and crying out of happiness. Kankurō thanks Naruto for saving Gaara, but Naruto tells him to thank Chiyo, who he believes simply passed out from resurrecting Gaara. Kankurō, however, explains to him and everyone else that Chiyo is dead, having given up her life in exchange for Gaara's. Temari tells Naruto that he really does have the power to change people, adding that Chiyo would have never given up her life to revive a Kazekage or a jinchūriki until she met Naruto; Kakashi adds that she died passing on the future to Naruto and Gaara. Sakura cries, and Chiyo's brother Ebizō notes how peaceful she looks and how he half-expects her to start laughing (as a callback to when she used to fake her death near him as a joke). Naruto remarks that she died in a selfless matter similar to the Third Hokage, and Gaara, managing to stand up on his feet, calls for a prayer to commemorate Chiyo's actions and bid her farewell.",

  "description": "Deidara pops out of a hole in the ground, having used a Suicide Bombing Clone in his attempt to kill Teams Kakashi and Guy. Although he believed the technique would have done the trick, he is grateful that he was able to survive due to the attack. Having only lost his right arm from the elbow down, he decides to search for its remains, as well as the Akatsuki ring that was on its finger.\nBack at the Akatsuki hideout, Zetsu arrives to scope out the aftermath of Sasori's battle, with his subordinate Tobi in tow. Zetsu finds Sasori's body and notes that he had never known how Sasori looked like before. Tobi manages to locate Sasori's Akatsuki ring, and asks if he can keep it and use it to fill the now empty spot in Akatsuki's ranks. Zetsu berates him for acting foolish, and Tobi responds in kind by accidentally dropping the ring into a crevice in the ground.\nIn Sunagakure, all of its citizens, including Baki, eagerly await by the border for the return of their Kazekage. They are overjoyed when they spot the Three Sand Siblings, Konoha's response team and Suna's own rescue unit. The citizens of Suna cheerfully celebrate the successful recovery of their leader. Gaara decides to let Chiyo's corpse be carried into the village first, as a sign of respect. As Gaara resumes office, Baki and Temari attempt to persuade Naruto and the others to stay in the village for a day or two, in order to recover and recuperate from their wounds. Kakashi and Sakura tell them that they must return and report to Tsunade regarding the completion of their mission. A report is sent in advance by Takamaru to Konoha, however the fates of Deidara and Sasori are omitted by Kakashi, who wishes to discuss it in person instead. With that, the Konoha shinobi depart back home, although not before stopping and paying their respects at Chiyo's grave. During their walk back to the village, Tenten pressures Guy to hurry up, who is lagging behind supporting Kakashi. Not wanting the others to wait for him, he tosses Kakashi in the air, placing his own backpack on his front and catching Kakashi in a piggyback fashion, which the others, especially Naruto and Sakura, find uncomfortable. Carrying Kakashi on his back, Guy uses his speed to run past them, telling them to catch up. Lee attempts to do the same with Neji, but the latter flat-out refuses.\nIn Konoha, Shizune receives the mission report from Suna and reports its success to Tsunade. Shizune expresses her concern over Tsunade's decision to send Naruto to engage against the Akatsuki, especially since Naruto, as a jinchūriki, is a target of the Akatsuki. Tsunade explains the reasoning behind her actions, telling Shizune that only a jinchūriki can truly understand another jinchūriki, and that Naruto has the ability for others to rely and depend on him.\nIn the woods near the Land of Rivers, Tobi and Zetsu locate Deidara's arm, with the former believing that Deidara is dead, having been blown to pieces. Deidara arrives at the same time, telling Tobi to drop his arm. Zetsu asks Deidara whether he had captured Naruto, but Deidara tells him that he had already done his duty (capturing Gaara). When Tobi mocks him, Deidara tells Tobi that if he were to bother him for a third time, he would react in kind. Tobi asks whether Deidara would proceed to blow him up; Zetsu responds that his reply counts as a third infraction, prompting Deidara to put Tobi in a neck hold using his legs.\nIn Konoha, a mysterious old man tells his pupil that he has arranged for him to be placed in Team Kakashi, with his mission being to keep an eye on Naruto Uzumaki. The man tells his pupil that from this moment onward, until the completion of his mission, his name is to be Sai. Sai accepts the name and responds by smiling. The man tells Sai to wipe the fake smile off his face, and Sai tells him that he had heard that smiling is a way to win people over, albeit revealing that he has trouble forming facial expressions.",

  "description": "Izumo Kamizuki and Kotetsu Hagane are tired, having been up guarding the entrance to Konoha. They notice a tremor, which ends up being Might Guy, running into the village at top speed with Kakashi on his back. Declaring himself as first place, he is soon caught up with by Lee, who declares himself second. Guy tells Lee that he is third and that Kakashi is second, causing Lee to tear up. This is witnessed not only by Izumo and Kotetsu, but by Naruto, Sakura, Tenten and Neji, who have caught up to them as well. The teams then head to the hospital in order to admit Kakashi, who is unable to move after having used his Mangekyō Sharingan during his fight with Akatsuki member Deidara with Tsunade revealing that Kakashi will be bedridden for an entire week as a result of the battle.\nAfter Kakashi is admitted to the hospital, Sakura sprints off to the balcony, which Naruto notices. On the balcony, she notifies Tsunade and Shizune of Sasori's last words - that one of his spies, who works for Orochimaru, is supposed to be meeting him six days from now at the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure. Tsunade brings up the idea that Sasori's final words may be a trap by Akatsuki, using the mention of Orochimaru's name as bait. Sakura is still adamant on going, claiming that they will defeat any Akatsuki member they encounter. Tsunade approves the quest, but tells Sakura that since Kakashi is unable to move for a week and that the rendez-vous is in six days, she will need to find a new team member to replace him on the mission. Shizune protests that she'll need to find two, since she believes Naruto should not go on any mission involving Akatsuki interference, and offers her own team. Tsunade responds that Naruto and Sakura are both driven by a need to save Sasuke, to the point where they would give their lives for him, and therefore possess the determination and will to complete the mission successfully, which is what sets them apart from Shizune's team. She also asks Shizune what Naruto would say if he had overheard her; Naruto happens to be standing on the roof, having heard the entire conversation. He announces that he will be on the search for a new team mate and heads off. Tsunade finds Naruto impatient, claiming she hadn't finished her speech about him, while Shizune muses on Tsunade's words (how Naruto has the power to make people rely and depend on him) and remembers that he is the one who won the First Hokage's necklace.\nIn the village, Naruto begins his quest to find a new teammate, musing that the teammate needs to be someone who is strong enough not to hold them back, someone who is friend in order for teamwork to be efficient, yet someone who is not too attractive as to distract Sakura. His outspoken thoughts are heard by Shino, who tells Naruto that it has been a while since they've met. Naruto is unable to recognise Shino immediately, insulting Shino, who believes that friends shouldn't forget one another. Their conversation is cut short by Kiba, who lands on Shino. Kiba is riding on Akamaru, who has grown to the point where he is big enough to sit on. Naruto recognises Kiba and Akamaru instantly, much to Shino's dismay. Naruto asks Kiba to join him on his mission, but Kiba states that Team 8 has already been assigned a mission and that they are simply waiting for Kurenai. Naruto spots Hinata watching them from afar, the latter of which is shy and embarrassed about encountering Naruto; Hinata faints when Naruto meets her face-to-face. As she recovers, Naruto asks Shino if he could help on their mission, since he considers Akamaru to be big enough to count as a member of a three-man squad. Shino simply remarks that Naruto was able to recognise Hinata as well, irritating Naruto. Naruto then asks Hinata to leave her team and to come with him; his words cause Hinata to go red in the face and to faint again.\nNaruto decides to ask Shikamaru for help, but the latter has been assigned by Tsunade to oversee the Chūnin Exams. Chōji appears, carrying Shikamaru's lunch and happy to have a reunion with Naruto. Chōji is willing to come with Naruto on his mission, despite already being assigned to a mission along with Asuma and Ino. Naruto mentions that Chōji has gained weight since they last met, prompting Shikamaru to tackle Naruto while Chōji expands his left arm. At that same moment, a beast made of ink comes charging at them, which Chōji manages to easily destroy. The attack seems to come from a Konoha shinobi (Sai), who is watching the trio from afar. Shikamaru decides to hold Sai in place with his Shadow Imitation Technique, and tells Naruto to handle the situation. Naruto heads towards Sai, only for Sai to paint six more beasts and bring them to life, sending them towards Naruto.",

  "description": "Tsunade, Shizune and Sakura remain on the balcony after Naruto headed off in search of a teammate. Shizune voices her concern once more about Tsunade's decision to send Naruto on missions involving the Akatsuki. Shizune's concerns lie regarding the fact that Naruto may be captured by the Akatsuki. Sakura recalls when Deidara attempted to catch Naruto, only to be stopped by Kakashi. She too becomes worried that without Kakashi on their team, the Akatsuki may succeed in their mission. Tsunade, understanding her worry, decides to appoint another member to their team as well, claiming that her two replacements will fill the positions on Team 7 left open by Kakashi and Sasuke.\nMeanwhile, Naruto rushes towards Sai, who has sent his six ink beasts to engage Naruto. Shikamaru uses his Shadow Sewing Technique to puncture the beasts, leaving Naruto free to attack Sai with a kunai; Sai blocks the move with his sword. When Sai mentions that Naruto is weak and does not have any balls, Naruto becomes infuriated. Shikamaru attempts to ensnare Sai using his Shadow Imitation Technique, but Sai jumps in mid-air to avoid it. Naruto demands to know who Sai is, but Sai responds that Naruto will soon find out. He then disappears using his Ink Mist Technique. As he disappears, Ino shows up, looking for Chōji. She spots Naruto and is overjoyed, citing him to be a sight for sore eyes.\nTsunade is called into a meeting by the village elders, members of the Konoha Council. They tell her that Shizune has been meeting with them recently to discuss Tsunade's decision to send Naruto on missions involving the Akatsuki, and tell Tsunade to limit the amount of missions Naruto goes on and to never let him outside the village. They go on to state that as a jinchūriki, he deserves to be kept confined and observed at all times, and thus believe their solution to be a compromise. The elders also state that if Naruto is ever to be given a mission, he is to be guarded by a member of the Anbu black ops at all times. Tsunade refuses to impose their restrictions on Naruto, believing Naruto to be a great ninja and asset to Konoha. However, she agrees that Team Kakashi should be restored to its original four-man state, and agrees to the elders' decision to assign a member to their team to keep on eye on Naruto. The two village elders call in Danzō, another village elder, who has selected a candidate from his Root programme to be Sasuke's replacement on Team Kakashi. Tsunade accepts the decision, but notifies them that Kakashi is out of commission, and thus she will be choosing a replacement for Kakashi as well. The elders state that the replacement must be from the Anbu as well. Tsunade agrees, and leaves the room.\nOn her way back to her office, she berates Shizune for her betrayal, but also voices her distrust of Danzō. She is also angered that Danzō suggested the same thing to the village elders that she was about to (having an Anbu member placed on Team Kakashi). Needing to find another Anbu member to take Kakashi's place, she summons an Anbu captain, to whom she bestows the name \"Yamato\". Yamato accepts his name, and is told to remove his mask as his mission is not an Anbu one. Yamato is given orders to not only keep an eye on Naruto, but to keep an eye on whomever Danzō had chosen to fill in for Sasuke. She explains that Danzō was an ardent opponent of her sensei, the Third Hokage, who also did not trust Danzō. She adds that Danzō was also responsible for forming a clandestine training unit known as Root, and despite the fact that the unit was disbanded officially years ago, she still suspects that Danzō is associated with it. Since Danzō's candidate is also tied to Root, she orders Yamato to keep tabs on him.\nNaruto and Sakura then meet up at the spot where Tsunade had told them to go, the former glad that they are getting two new teammates. However, Naruto becomes incensed when he realises that Sasuke's replacement is none other than Sai; Yamato greets them as their new captain, but instantly recognises that the animosity between Naruto and Sai will be a challenge for him.",

  "description": "Yamato assumes his position as interim captain of Team Kakashi; however, conflicts arrive when Naruto opposes Sai's addition to the team, telling Sakura that Sai had attacked him while he was with Team 10 earlier on in the day. Sai explains that his actions were merely to test Naruto's power, to which he has deduced that Naruto is nothing but a mere weakling. Naruto takes offence at his words, and attempts to strike Sai, only to be held back by Sakura. Sakura berates Sai's actions, but Sai states that he likes everyone, including ugly girls like Sakura. This only infuriates Sakura, but she is held back by Yamato before she can attack him. Yamato tells the team that their mission is to apprehend Sasori's spy at the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure, and that the successful completion of their mission will lead to the assassination of Orochimaru and possible retrieval of former Team Kakashi member Sasuke Uchiha. With that, Yamato dismisses the team, telling them to gather their belongings and to meet him at the front gates in an hour.\nSai heads to his room, packing his gear, when he is attacked by a mysterious man. The man is revealed to be a member of the Anbu, who came to provide a secret report commissioned by their superior, Danzō Shimura. After noticing that Sai is taking a remnant of his childhood with him, the man tells Sai to remember that as members of Root, they are to have no feelings or emotion, as they are the invisible root, the foundation, that holds up the tree known as Konohagakure. With that, the man departs. Naruto and Sakura walk back to their homes, with Sakura remarking that Sai reminds her of Sasuke. Naruto dismisses her opinion, citing that Sasuke is a million times better than Sai could ever be. Sakura and Naruto then go to their respective homes to pack their gear. Naruto glances at the official team photo of Team 7 and renews his original vow to rescue Sasuke.\nMeanwhile, Jiraiya arrives at the hospital to visit Kakashi. Giving Kakashi two volumes of Icha Icha, he states that he is also there to discuss something, although they must wait for Tsunade and Yamato. Although Kakashi does not recognise the name of Yamato, he is told by Jiraiya that it is a code name and that he would recognise the man when he saw him. Tsunade and Yamato soon arrive at the hospital; Yamato is briefed by Kakashi regarding Naruto's Version 1 form, in which the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra would envelop Naruto, causing him to sprout a chakra tail and go berserk. Yamato is visibly stunned by this, and Kakashi explains that by using a Chakra-Suppressing Seal, he was able to stop Naruto at just two tails. Jiraiya, who was unaware that Naruto had activated the form in his last mission, becomes grim. Kakashi asks Jiraiya how many tails he himself had seen; taking off his shirt, Jiraiya tells them that he had only been close to death twice in his life. He explains that the first time was when he was caught peeking into a ladies' hot springs by Tsunade, at which the point Tsunade broke his arms and ribs and crushed his internal organs. Showing them a scar on his torso, he explains that the second time was when Naruto entered into a four-tailed version of the Nine-Tails' cloak. This visibly worries the group, due to the fact that Naruto is able to grow up to nine tails.\nReady to meet Yamato, Sai and Naruto, Sakura spots Tsunade and Shizune returning from the hospital. She asks if they could speak before she departs, and they convene in Tsunade's office. Tsunade asks Sakura to brief her regarding their initial encounter with Sai. Just then, Danzō enters the room, asking whether Tsunade has appointed an Anbu member on Team Kakashi. Tsunade tells him that Kakashi's replacement was a member of the Anbu from the Third Hokage's time; this prompts Danzō to state that he wishes that the replacement is not as passive or gentle as Sarutobi was, claiming that Sarutobi's gutless actions were unwarranted. As he leaves, Sakura asks who he is. Tsunade tells her that Danzō was a rival of her sensei, who also vied for the position of Hokage. She explains that unlike the Third's pacifist nature, Danzō is a hardened man of military mind, and that the two are polar opposites. While she herself does not trust Danzō, she tells Sakura that Danzō himself despises her for being the granddaughter of the First Hokage, whose teachings the Third passed on (thereby making him a passive fool in Danzō's eyes) and for being the student of the Third herself. Sakura then realises she's almost out of time and with Tsunade's blessing, she heads to the front gates to meet the rest of her team.\nAs the four members of Team Kakashi arrive at the gate, Yamato leads them on as they depart the village.",

  "description": "Back in Tsunade's office, Shizune voices her concern regarding Naruto and Sai's friction. Tsunade pins the blame on Shizune, claiming that if Shizune hadn't approached the village elders of the Konoha Council, then Sai would not have been added to the team. Shizune justifies her actions by telling Tsunade that she did not think that they would appoint one of Danzō's Root members to Team Kakashi. Tsunade orders Shizune to find out what Danzō is up to and who exactly Sai is, and adds that she is counting on Sakura to diffuse any tension between Naruto and Sai. Shizune, however, does not think Sakura is capable of doing so, as she believes Sakura has inherited Tsunade's quick temper.\nOn the way to the Tenchi Bridge in Kusagakure, Naruto continues to glare at Sai. This prompts Sai to respond that if Naruto continues, he would hit him. Naruto is offended at the remark and lashes back. Yamato tells them that he had hoped Kakashi had taught them the value of teamwork during his tenure as team leader, and tells the group that a team needs to be founded on teamwork and trust. Naruto retorts that Sai will never be considered a true member of Team Kakashi, and that the one and only fourth member will always be Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto tells Sai that he is nothing but a stand in for Sasuke; Sai replies that he is glad that he is nothing like Sasuke as he views Sasuke to be a traitor. Naruto almost attacks Sai, but his attack is stopped by Sakura. Sakura asks Sai to forgive Naruto, telling him that Naruto is only acting the way he is because he hasn't gotten around to knowing Sai. She flashes Sai a smile, which lowers his guard. Sakura then proceeds to punch him in the face, sending him flying across the ground. Sakura tells him that while she may ask him to forgive Naruto, she does not care whether he forgives her. She warns him that if he utters any more remarks regarding Sasuke, she will not hold back next time. Sai resolves to keep his mouth shut around her, but thanks her for the opportunity for showing him that a fake smile could be used to cover a sneak attack. Yamato, sick of their fighting, creates a wooden cage. Sakura is shocked by his usage of Wood Release, since the one and only user is said to be the First Hokage, and wonders how Yamato is able to use it.\nYamato tells the team that they can either spend their time locked in the wooden cage or spend the rest of the day at a hot springs. The team chooses the latter, and they rest at a hot spring. Yamato tells Sai and Naruto that there is no better way to bond than to be naked and together in a hot spring. Naruto gets up, visibly discomforted by Yamato's words, only for Sai to remark that he is surprised that Naruto has balls after all. Naruto goes on a loud, verbal tirade regarding Sai's remarks regarding testicles, which the women on the other side of the hot springs overhear and laugh about; Sakura is embarrassed by Naruto and Sai. Naruto hears the laughter and becomes embarrassed himself, and Sai tells him that at least he gave Sakura a laugh. Realising that Sakura is nude on the other side of the fence, he decides to peek. Yamato, however, tells him that Jiraiya almost died when he had both of his arms and his ribs broken and his internal organs crushed, which was caused by Tsunade when he peeked on her at a hot spring. He warns Naruto that Sakura would do the same, and Naruto is paralysed in fear, staying firmly rooted in his place as Sai and Yamato exit the spring.\nAfter their dip in the springs, the three shinobi are greeted by a feast laid out in front of this eyes. Naruto hopes that Yamato remains as their team leader if a feast awaits them during every mission, an opinion Sakura echoes. Yamato reveals that he had paid for the hot springs and for the meal out of his pocket, in an attempt to boost team morale. The team then head off to bed.\nThe next morning, Sai gets dressed and slips out of the window while Naruto continues to sleep. Sakura wakes up, and looking out her window, spots Sai suspiciously walking on a wall.",

  "description": "Naruto has a nightmare about Sakura and all the other women he knows covered in a towel about to pummel him for peeking. He wakes up from the nightmare and realises that Sai is missing. He goes outside and runs into Yamato, who tells him that Sai is outside and asks him to round him and Sakura up so that they may depart on their mission.\nSakura spots Sai drawing and decides to get dressed and see what he is doing. She expresses surprise at his artistic ability, not believing that someone with a cold exterior could be sensitive on the inside. She asks what his work is called, and he responds that he does not give his artwork titles. Sakura presses on, telling him that an artist usually names artwork after the feelings and thoughts that come into their mind while creating the piece. Sai explains that he has created thousands of artwork but does not name then because he does not feel any emotions. Naruto, who overhears, simply states that he is not surprised that a cold-hearted person like Sai does not have feelings. Naruto glimpses at Sai's work and remarks that it is nothing special; Sai retorts by saying that Naruto's penis is also not special, causing Sakura to giggle and to give Naruto visible embarrassment. Sai tells them to go on without him, and that he will catch up to them after he has finished packing. Sakura decides to help him pack, and notices a picture book. Sai tells her that he drew it; Sakura asks if she could take a look at it on the road, but Sai refuses, citing that it belonged to his older brother and that he doesn't show it to anyone. Yamato meets them at the exit, ready to set off, and notices that the team is still not cooperating. However, Sakura and Naruto put on fake smiles to diffuse the situation, and the team continue their mission.\nWhile walking to Kusagakure, Yamato quickly exits the path and begins to walk through a forest. He explains that Sakura's information may be just an Akatsuki trap, and that they may try to capture Naruto. After walking until nightfall, Yamato finds a nice open clearing and decides to call it a night. Using his Wood Release ability, Yamato creates a wooden house for the team to sleep in. However, before going to bed, Yamato decides to discuss the finer points of their mission. Since Orochimaru's spy is awaiting Sasori, Yamato plans to pretend to be Sasori inside of his Hiruko puppet. Despite requesting information from Suna, he asks Sakura to fill in the gaps and reveal Sasori's quirks or mannerisms, in order to pull the deception off. He explains that he will be going first, and that their goal is to capture the spy without killing or injuring him. He appoints Naruto, Sai and Sakura as his backup should he fail to capture the spy and is forced into a combat situation. In the event that combat should arise, Yamato tells them that they must use the buddy system, where two shinobi fight while protecting one another simultaneously. He places Sakura on his team, leaving Naruto and Sai to be the second team. Naruto, however, does not wish to fight alongside Sai.",

  "description": "Naruto and Sai are hiding behind a rock observing the Tenchi Bridge when they spot Orochimaru's subordinate on the bridge. Naruto hears the sound of a bell and turns around to see Sasori, inside of his Hiruko puppet and dressed in the Akatsuki robe, walking towards the bridge. As \"Sasori\" gives a thumbs-up, Naruto and Sai launch an attack on the spy, who happens to be Yamato in disguise, \"Sasori/Hiruko\" being Sakura in disguise. Naruto and Sai attempt to use taijutsu to attack Yamato, but Yamato is able to avoid all of them and kick Naruto, citing that their attacks are not good enough. Naruto and Sai head towards Yamato once more, criss-crossing diagonally. Sai holds his right hand behind him so that Naruto can create a Rasengan in Sai's palm, but Yamato is able to his Wood Release ability to cause roots to sprout from the ground, entangling Sai. Sai, however, is revealed to be none other than a Naruto shadow clone. Naruto tackles Yamato, and the real Sai, hiding behind a tree, uses his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to paint a snake and bring it to \"life\". He sends it to wrap itself around Naruto and Yamato, but the latter uses a Body Replacement Technique to avoid being tied. Sai runs off in search of the real Yamato, leaving Naruto tied up.\nNaruto and Sakura manage to locate Sai in the forest, who has captured Yamato. Yamato mentally remarks that Sai's skill level is too high for him to just be an alternate on this team, and believes that Tsunade had reason to doubt his placement. Sai also notes that Sakura's strength is impressive, as she managed to rip his ink snake apart, and makes a note to avoid being hit by her. Naruto angrily asks Sai if he knows what the meaning of comrade is. Sai writes out of the word comrade on a scroll, irritating Naruto, who wants to know why Sai left him tied up. Sai explains that there was no reason for Naruto make his shadow clone look like Sai if he was going to have the Sai shadow clone perform a jutsu only the real Naruto knew; by doing so, he had revealed to Yamato that the real Sai was in hiding elsewhere. When Yamato had used a Body Replacement technique to avoid the binding, Naruto had lost his cool; thus Sai decided that since he could not find and capture Yamato while also looking out for someone like Naruto, he would simply keep the latter bound until the mission was complete. Naruto begins to walk off in anger, but Sai asks him why he is so keen on saving a comrade like Sasuke when Sasuke chose to abandon his friends and Konoha for Orochimaru. Naruto clenches his fists in anger, causing Yamato to fear that Naruto will enter his Version 2 form. However, Naruto simply states that he would do anything to save a comrade, even if it means working with someone like Sai.\nSakura explains to Sai that Sasuke is like a brother to Naruto, and asks him to sympathise as he has a brother as well. Sai reveals that his brother had died, and that he had no clue how one would look like if they had lost a brother. He wonders if the look on Naruto's face is the same look. Sakura is taken aback by his words, and Sai reminds her that he does not feel any emotions. Yamato tells the team to go back to their wooden house for the night, and Sakura tells Sai that is he is lucky. She reminds him that she had told him earlier that she would not hold back if he spoke ill of Sasuke again; however, like Naruto, she is willing to tolerate him if it means saving Sasuke. Yamato then dispels the \"Tenchi Bridge\" (a fake created using Wood Release), and the team return to their camp, where they prepare to meet up with Orochimaru's spy the next day at the real Tenchi Bridge.",

  "description": "Sai uses his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to create small mice that scout out the Tenchi Bridge. After discovering that there are no traps or individuals on the bridge, thus ruling out the possibility of an Akatsuki ambush, Yamato uses his Wood Release: Transformation technique to turn into Sasori's puppet Hiruko, based on an image provided to him by Sunagakure. After managing to get Hiruko's voice, Yamato sets off towards Tenchi Bridge. Sai, Naruto and Sakura wait behind a rock, observing the bridge. The spy eventually arrives at the bridge around the same time that Yamato does. The spy reveals himself to be none other than Kabuto Yakushi, a Medical-nin formerly of Konohagakure. Kabuto explains that he had just recently experienced Sasori's sleeper spy ninjutsu, and that he had risked his life getting away from Orochimaru long enough to sneak to the bridge. Naruto contemplates on joining Yamato on the bridge as he cannot hear their conversation, but Sakura explains that it is the very wind that hides Kabuto's conversation from their ears that also hides their presence from Kabuto. Unbeknowst to them, Orochimaru himself is observing \"Sasori\" and Kabuto on the bridge.\nYamato inquires as to where Orochimaru and Sasuke are, and Yamato replies that Orochimaru has a secret hideout not too far from the bridge. Asking \"Sasori\" for the object he requested, Yamato believes that he cannot keep the charade up for too long, and pulls out a kunai to apprehend Kabuto. Just at that moment, Orochimaru arrives in an instant, attempting to use his snakes to bind Kabuto, who leaps out of the way and joins his \"Lord Sasori\". Yamato realises that he is in a pickle - Orochimaru is too powerful for him to take on one-on-one; he could try to fight him alongside Kabuto, but Kabuto would realise that he is not the real Sasori due to the fact that Yamato is not a puppet master; Yamato could signal for his three comrades to help, but Kabuto would most likely flee. Kabuto prepares a chakra scalpel to strike Orochimaru, but instead turns out and slices \"Hiruko\". The jab breaks the wooden puppet and Yamato jumps into mid-air, having been cut on his right arm. Orochimaru attempts to kill him using his Many Hidden Shadow Snake Hands technique, but Yamato uses a variant of the Body Replacement Technique that uses Wood Release to escape. Orochimaru is surprised at his usage of Wood Release and seems to recognise him. Kabuto, who is actually working with Orochimaru, asks him whether Yamato is Sasori, as Kabuto never saw Sasori's real face. Orochimaru states that it is not, and that he will tell Kabuto about Yamato later; he then asks Yamato to signal his three teammates who are in hiding. Naruto, Sai and Sakura appear, and Kabuto and Orochimaru are amused to see Naruto and Sakura once more. Orochimaru is interested that the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki has tagged along, and muses whether he or Sasuke is the strongest. Naruto's eyes, upon facing Orochimaru and Kabuto, turn red due to the Nine-Tails' influence.",

  "description": "Yamato signals for the rest of Team Kakashi to join him on Tenchi Bridge. Kabuto and Orochimaru are amused to see Naruto and Sakura again, the latter musing whether he should bring Sasuke here to pit him against the jinchūriki. Naruto, who is already under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra, begins to enter into his one-tailed form. Sakura and Sai watch in a mix of shock and surprise as the chakra surrounding Naruto's body begins to engulf the air. As Orochimaru mentions Sasuke's name again, Naruto grows a second tail and rushes at him with superhuman speed, punching Orochimaru in the face and causing him to go through several yards worth of trees. As Orochimaru makes his way back to the bridge, the part of his face where Naruto struck him has peeled, revealing the face of Gen'yūmaru, the host body Orochimaru is currently occupying. Using his Face Copying Technique, Orochimaru reapplies his face as he remarks how Naruto is finally beginning to act like a jinchūriki; Kabuto himself states that Naruto, using the Nine-Tailed Fox's power, has grown considerably in strength.\nYamato recalls his conversation with Jiraiya, Tsunade and Kakashi at the Konoha Hospital, where Kakashi and Jiraiya were warning him about Naruto's \"Nine-Tails' Cloak Form\". Jiraiya had told Yamato that other than the time where Tsunade nearly killed him for peeking on her when she was nude, the only other time he had almost died was when Naruto entered his four-tailed form. Jiraiya explained that whenever Naruto gave in to anger, the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra would begin to leak out and envelop him. As Naruto's anger and rage grew, he would begin to grow more tails. On top of that, Naruto could only maintain his consciousness up to three tails; if he were to grow a fourth, his mind would succumb to the Nine-Tails' influence and he would instinctively attack on pure rage alone. Jiraiya likens Naruto's Version 2 form to being a mini version of the Nine-Tailed Fox itself. Jiraiya revealed to the group that when Naruto enters into his four-tailed form, the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox burns his skin off, causing immense pain and leaving Naruto to be covered by just blood and chakra. After the transformation subsides, the Nine-Tails' chakra then begins to heal him; the process of egregious damage followed by rapid recovery is shortening Naruto's lifespan. Tsunade had asked how this is even possible, and Jiraiya had explained that the seal the Fourth Hokage had used was beginning to weaken over time, explaining why Naruto was succumbing to the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra much more during his bouts of anger as opposed to when he was younger. Tsunade, Jiraiya and Kakashi tell Yamato that he is the only one who can keep Naruto in check since he has the power of the First Hokage in his blood.\nBack on the bridge, Orochimaru realises that Yamato is team captain only because Naruto is a jinchūriki, citing that Konoha should be grateful for his experiments. When Kabuto asks what he means, Orochimaru reveals that back when he was a Konoha shinobi, he harvested DNA cells from the remains of the First Hokage and attempted to transplant them into babies and children; none of them survived, however. Before he could officially terminate the experiment and dispose of the subjects, he had been caught by the Third Hokage with another experiment in another laboratory, forcing him to flee Konoha. He realises that one of those babies who had been injected with the First Hokage's cells had survived, and that the child is none other than Yamato. Sakura recalls Yamato creating the wooden cage and how she wondered how Yamato was able to use the First's technique, and finally understands the reasoning. Orochimaru adds that the First Hokage had the ability to control tailed beasts, and that since Yamato has the power of the First within him, Konoha assigned him to keep watch on Naruto and control him if need be.\nWhen Naruto demands that Orochimaru and Kabuto return Sasuke to them, the duo state that Sasuke came to them of his own accord. Orochimaru tells Naruto that if he wishes to know anything about Sasuke then he would have to beat it out of him. Naruto gives in even more to the Nine-Tails' influence and grows a third tail. The sprouting of the third tail causes the chakra in the air to intensify, causing a burning sensation to everyone else on the bridge. Sai realises that Naruto's true power comes from the demon fox, and Orochimaru, after staring into Naruto's changing pupils, senses the burgeoning Nine-Tailed Fox within. Naruto's three-tailed form then begins to form a chakra vortex above them.",

  "description": "An infuriated Naruto, now in his three-tailed form, prepares to attack Orochimaru. Kabuto, sensing the attack, decides to strike Naruto from behind with his Chakra Scalpel. Naruto notices him coming and emits a roar, and his chakra sends Kabuto flying backwards into Sakura, knocking her out. Kabuto continues to soar through the bridge, with Sai and Yamato moving out of the way, as he crashes into a tree in the woods. Naruto's attack ends up destroying the Tenchi Bridge, and he goes after Orochimaru, who is on the other side of the bridge. Sai claims that it is the perfect time for his real mission to start, and using his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique creates a giant ink bird. He begins to fly in Naruto and Orochimaru's direction while Sakura, who is knocked out, begins to fall off the bridge. Yamato asks Sai to catch her, but Sai, despite being able to do so, avoids her and lets her fall. Yamato uses his Wood Release ability to steady the collapsing bridge and to catch Sakura.\nOn the other side, the three-tailed Naruto manages to rip Orochimaru's arm off. Orochimaru, however, uses a body replacement technique that causes him to materialise and regurgitate a new body from his mouth, restoring the limb he had lost. Orochimaru claims that Naruto still isn't good enough and that he's not as strong as Sasuke. In the woods, Kabuto uses his chakra to heal his wounds, while remarking that he finally understands why the Akatsuki are after Naruto, having experienced a sample of the true power of a jinchūriki.\nNaruto begins to fade into the recesses of his mind, where he finds himself in a dark area covered with water. However, as the light appears, he sees Sasuke running. Naruto attempts to follow him, but is unable to run through the water quickly enough to catch Sasuke, who is riding on top of the water. As the water rises, Naruto struggles to move underwater as Sasuke disappears from view. Naruto recalls his last fight with Sasuke, and how he was unable to prevent his friend from defecting and joining Orochimaru. He berates himself for lacking the strength to stop Sasuke, and vows that he will not allow Sasuke to break the bond of friendship they have between them. Naruto then begins to float through the water until he reaches a huge cage. Naruto begins to slip through the bars of the cage, which is where the Nine-Tailed Fox is imprisoned. The demon fox holds Naruto in his palms as he begins to allow his power to take over Naruto.\nIn the real world, the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox begins to rip, burn and peel away Naruto's skin, leaving just blood and chakra; his peeled skin is soon incinerated by the chakra. Naruto sprouts a fourth tail, and enters into his Version 2 form. Yamato and Sakura notices a smoke-like trail left by his chakra while Sai observes the transformation from above. Yamato stays with Sakura while creating a wood clone to find Naruto. Naruto's painful transformation causes him to emanate a wave of chakra, which cracks the trees around them and bursts the giant ink bird Sai is riding on. The Yamato wood clone manages to protect itself by using Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall, forming a wooden shield. Orochimaru, who also survives the attack, states that Naruto has managed to pique his interest, and wonders what the outcome will be. The Yamato wood clone then sees Naruto's four-tailed form, and curses himself for being unable to prevent it. Naruto, now having no skin, no conscious hold on his body and covered only in blood and chakra, lets out a devastating roar.",

  "description": "Naruto, in his four-tailed form, begins fighting against Orochimaru. Orochimaru attempts to use his snakes to grab a hold of Naruto, but the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra end up incinerating the snakes. As the chakra begins to burn Orochimaru as well, he uses his body replacement technique to regurgitate a new body out of his mouth before the old one is incinerated. Retaining the bottom half of a snake, he slithers in a rapid manner towards Naruto and punches Naruto in the face. Naruto is able to grow another fox head and claws out his chakra and manages to bisect Orochimaru. Using his Gathering of the Snakes technique, Orochimaru is able to connect and regenerate both of his halves. He attempts to finish Naruto off by spitting out one thousand snakes, each armed with a sword in their mouths. However, Naruto uses one hand to create a devastating blast of pure chakra that incinerates the snakes and sends Orochimaru flying. Sai and the Yamato wood clone are unable to interfere due to the intensity of the battle; the wood clone, however, informs Yamato that Naruto has indeed reached his four-tailed form.\nSakura and Yamato are approached on the remains of the Tenchi Bridge by Kabuto, who wonders how Konoha knew that he was to meet Sasori at this time and place. Kabuto states that not even the other Akatsuki members knew of the meeting, and since Sasori isn't the type to give up information under torture, he must have been captured or killed. When Sakura tells him that it's the latter, Kabuto finds joy in it. He tells Yamato and Sakura that Sasori bore a grudge towards Orochimaru and always claimed that he would kill him, and therefore must have told them about his secret meeting in order for them to kill Orochimaru on his behalf.\nOn the other side of the destroyed bridge, Naruto prepares himself to use the ultimate tailed beast technique - Tailed Beast Ball. Yamato's wood clone wonders how Naruto is still able to move despite having so much chakra on his body, and Orochimaru echoes the sentiment, claiming that that degree of dense chakra should weigh him down. As Naruto swallows the chakra balls, the increased density does indeed cause him to sink into the ground; nonetheless, he fires the Tailed Beast Bomb as a beam towards Orochimaru. The Sannin tries to block the move by summoning Triple Rashōmon, one of his highest defensive techniques, but the Triple Rashōmon is completely obliterated by the Tailed Beast Bomb. At the end of his rope, Orochimaru resorts to using his Sword of Kusanagi in an attempt to impale Naruto. While the sword does hit him, it does not impale; instead, Naruto is send flying through the air and into a wall near the bridge. Sakura, Yamato and Kabuto witness Naruto's four-tailed form for the first time, and Kabuto remarks that this is the closest Naruto has ever gotten to fully transforming into the Nine-Tailed Fox; Sakura is terrified at Naruto's appearance.",

  "description": "Naruto, in his four-tailed form, is pinned against the side of a cliff by Orochimaru's Sword of Kusanagi. However, the Sword of Kusanagi is unable to pierce Naruto's body due to the Nine-Tails' chakra coating it. Orochimaru retracts the sword and slowly begins his descent back to his body. Sai is observing Orochimaru, unaware that he is being watched by Yamato's wood clone. Orochimaru states that Gen'yūmaru's body is beginning to reject him and that he is at his limit right now, though he comforts himself over the thought of still having Sasuke.\nKabuto states that he is surprised that Naruto would go this far to save Sasuke, claiming that the boy is gone and only the monster remains. His words cause Sakura to remember Naruto's promise to her - that he would bring Sasuke back no matter what, and that as his nindo, he would not go back on his promise. Sakura runs towards him in tears, despite Yamato's warning. She attempts to tell Naruto to change back, but Naruto simply smacks her aside with his tail, harming her. Before he can kill her, Yamato uses his Wood Release ability to create tree trunks to bind Naruto. Kabuto heads towards Sakura, and Yamato, believing that he is about to finish off a wounded Sakura, binds him as well. Kabuto tells him that he is actually attempting to save Sakura, and he heals her wounds to the best of his ability. He tells them that they share a common enemy - the Akatsuki - and that he is sparing and saving their lives just so that they can continue to dwindle down their numbers. As Kabuto leaves, Naruto manages to break out of the wooden restraints. Yamato uses the Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands, which utilises the power of the First Hokage's Wood Release and the crystal gem in the First Hokage's Necklace (which Naruto is wearing) to suppress and seal a tailed beast's chakra. With excruciating effort and pain on both Yamato and Naruto's side, Yamato begins to revert Naruto back to his humane self.\nMeanwhile, Sai approaches Orochimaru, claiming that he means no harm and that he is only an envoy of Danzō Shimura sent to relay a message. Orochimaru is surprised that Danzō is still alive and agrees to hear the message, but warns Sai to choose his words very carefully, lest he get killed. Sai responds that he cannot choose his words carefully as he can only relay the exact message Danzō told him. As he smiles at Orochimaru, the Sannin launches a sword towards Sai.",

  "description": "Sai conveys a message from his superior, Danzō Shimura, to Orochimaru. Orochimaru, however, responds by throwing a sword at Sai. The sword impales him, but Sai turns out to be just an ink clone. Orochimaru tells Sai that he has no manners, and that while addressing someone of a higher rank, he must do so face-to-face. The real Sai pops out of the ground, and Orochimaru tells him to prove that he can be trusted. As he attempts to retrieve something out of his pack, he is tackled by Kabuto. Sai's belongings fall out and scatter on the ground, including an envelope. Sai tells Orochimaru that the contents of the envelope is personally addressed to the Sannin by Danzō himself. After opening the envelope, Orochimaru tells Yamato that Sai would be coming with them, and the trio depart, unaware that they are being observed by Yamato's wood clone.\nMeanwhile, the real Yamato uses his Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands on a four-tailed Naruto, suppressing and sealing the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra and reverting him to back to human, although the process is excruciatingly painful and renders Naruto unconscious. Sakura notices that all of Naruto's skin has been burned off and that he is extremely wounded, and uses her Mystical Palm Technique to regenerate his skin. As she heals him, she asks Yamato to teach her his technique, but the captain explains that only he can perform that technique as he carries the DNA of the First Hokage within him. He tells her that the necklace that Naruto wears, which is the First Hokage's Necklace, is made of a special gem that is able to control a jinchūriki or a tailed beast when conjoined with the First Hokage's chakra, and therefore only those who have his cells can replicate it, although to a lesser degree than the First could have himself.\nSakura manages to regenerate Naruto's burned skin and Naruto regains consciousness. Upon seeing Sakura's tearful face, he believes Sai is to blame, and that he must have criticised her monstrous strength or called her ugly. Sakura tells him that while Sai called her ugly, he never mentioned her monstrous strength, and punches Naruto for mentioning it. Sakura then realises that Sai is not with them, and Yamato informs them that he has gone off with Orochimaru, most likely operating under a different mission than their own.\nAs they begin to set off, Naruto notices the destroyed Tenchi Bridge and the devastated terrain, noticing that the ground itself is soft. He asks what happened and why he was unconscious to begin with, and Sakura pins it on Orochimaru, telling Naruto that the Sannin knocked him out. Naruto is irritated that he was knocked out, while Yamato recalls Jiraiya telling him that Naruto lost consciousness after growing a fourth tail. The trio notices Sai's belongings on the floor, including his most prized possession - the picture book belonging to Sai's older brother. Sakura wonders why he would have left it, and Yamato concludes that he must have been in quite a rush. Naruto is still unable to believe that Sai would betray them, but Sakura remembers Tsunade warning her to be wary of Sai, as he is the subordinate of Danzō, someone who opposed and is the opposite of the Third Hokage and despises Tsunade for being his student and the granddaughter of the First. She relays Danzō's suspicious nature to her team, and Yamato tells them that he believes Danzō may be plotting the destruction of Konohagakure.",

  "description": "Naruto wonders what it means for there to be a plot to destroy Konoha. Sakura tells him that Danzō does not like Tsunade because, as the favourite student of the Third Hokage and the granddaughter of the First Hokage, she embodies their principles. Yamato also reveals that Tsunade handpicked every member of Konoha's current hierarchy and everyone she selected also possesses those principles. Since Danzō does not agree with those principles, it is very likely that he is planning to collaborate with Orochimaru to destroy Konoha, so that Tsunade would become ousted as Hokage following the aftermath, allowing Danzō to become the new Hokage and to subsequently rebuild the village as he sees fit. Sakura deduces that while Orochimaru failed last time, Danzō is most likely offering internal support this time around, with Sai being the mutual conduit. Yamato tells them that Sai must be eliminated, and decides to follow Orochimaru, Sai and Kabuto. However, Naruto is still unable to properly see or move. Sakura wishes to wait until he recovers, but Yamato tells her to leave him where he is. Sakura alerts him that Kakashi would never have done that, prompting Yamato to tell her that he and Kakashi are different and that they are not children to be protected. As shinobi of Konoha, they need to surpass Kakashi and complete their mission. Naruto manages to get up and tells Yamato that he will be able to keep up, and the team sets off.\nYamato's wood clone continues to pursue Orochimaru, Sai and Kabuto, and they decide to set a trap. Kabuto creates a corpse that resembles Sai and rigs it with kunai, shuriken and explosive tags. Yamato's wood clone inadvertently triggers the trap, cutting off his communication with the real Yamato.\nAs Yamato, Naruto and Sakura attempt to pursue them through the forest, Naruto's vision becomes blurred, causing him to nearly hit a tree trunk. He maneuvers himself out of the way in the nick of time, and Sakura, who was keeping her eyes on Naruto, attempts to get to higher ground as well; however, the wound in her right arm causes her to release her grip and she plummets. Naruto attempts to catch her in mid-air but fails, and Yamato speeds to the ground in order to safely catch her. Naruto notices the wound on her arm and asks how she got it, prompting Sakura to lie to him that it was caused by Orochimaru. She tells them that she will be fine, but Yamato tells her to rest. Despite his initial words that they could not waste any time in their pursuit, Yamato explains that there is a difference between rushing and being reckless. As Sakura attempts to heal her wounds (to no avail), Yamato appoints Naruto as his new combat partner and begins to walk into the woods in order for the pair to develop a battle strategy. However, as soon as they get out of Sakura's earshot, Yamato tells Naruto that he was the one who caused Sakura's injury.",

  "description": "Yamato tells Naruto that he was the one who caused Sakura's injury, causing Naruto to recall a bloodied Jiraiya who questioned whether he retained any memory of the attack or not. Naruto realises that he was the one who destroyed Tenchi Bridge and the surrounding terrain, and Yamato berates him for succumbing to anger and unleashing a power he was already aware could hurt the individuals near him. Yamato tells Naruto that the Nine-Tailed Fox's power is not his own, and to not rely on that power to save Sasuke or protect Sakura. Instead, he is told to rely on his own natural abilities, which he claims makes Naruto strong enough.\nSai, Orochimaru and Kabuto continue to run on a river, heading to their base. They decide to stop and take a break in order for Kabuto clean his medical supplies and weapons. Kabuto tells Orochimaru that he needs a new male cadaver, between the ages of 15 and 17, to replace the one he had summoned to lay their trap. Sai notices that his picture book is not in his bag and recalls dropping his belongings when Kabuto had ambushed him.\nAs Naruto and Yamato discuss a combat strategy, Sakura decides to read Sai's picture book. She invites Naruto and Yamato to come take a look too, and they discover that the book is about two young boys who fight enemies, vanquishing them and taking their armour and weapons. In the middle, the two boys face off against one another; however, one page is blank while the other page has a black-haired boy with no face. Naruto points out that the black-haired boy is none other than Sai, and Sakura deduces that the other boy must be his brother, who had died.\nOrochimaru, Sai and Kabuto finally reach their hideout. As they enter, Sai notices a man waiting for them, whom he immediately realises is none other than Sasuke Uchiha. Sasuke, with his Sharingan activated, tells Orochimaru that he is late.",

  "description": "In Orochimaru's hideout, Sai finally comes face-to-face with Sasuke, the man that Naruto and Sakura have been searching for. Sasuke is impatient, as he was waiting for Orochimaru to teach him a new technique. When Sai attempts to introduce himself to Sasuke, Sasuke uses his Sharingan to place him under a unique genjutsu, which fills the usually emotionless Sai with fear and brings him down to his knees. Sai regains his composure and tells Sasuke that he must be the one Naruto is looking for. The mention of Naruto's name piques Sasuke's interest, but the latter merely rebuffs that he sounds familiar. Sai then tells Sasuke that Sakura had told him that Naruto thought of him as a brother; Sasuke responds that he only has one brother, and that is the one he must kill. With that, Sasuke disappears, and Orochimaru heads off as well, leaving Sai with Kabuto. Before he leaves, he gives the contents of Danzō's envelope to Kabuto and tells him to prepare a Bingo Book. Kabuto opens the envelope and to his surprise, discovers that the contents are the personnel files of every Anbu member under the Hokage's command, including those assigned to the Hokage Guard Platoon.\nOn the outside, Yamato, Naruto and Sakura meet up with Yamato's wood clone, who tells them that Orochimaru's hideout is right behind a rock. Yamato absorbs his wood clone and gives the team its remnants - tracking seeds, which the team swallows. Yamato tells them that he planted one in Sai's food and one on Sai's clothing, which is how the wood clone tracked him. Yamato then uses his Earth Release: Tunnelling Technique to create a large hole in order to sneak into the base undetected. He tells Sakura to follow him first. As Naruto prepares to jump, he muses that he has finally caught up to Sasuke.\nThe Konoha team reaches a dead end; Naruto suggests destroying the wall with his Rasengan, but Sakura reminds him that in doing so, he would alert Orochimaru to their presence. Yamato uses his Wood Release: Hand Tool Manipulation technique to transform his finger into a drilling tree branch, eventually shaping it into a block of wood. The process opens a hole in the wall for the trio to infiltrate through, and Yamato warns the team to limit their usage of chakra as to avoid detection.\nKabuto leads Sai to his room, telling Sai to be quiet unless needed. Not trusting him as he is a member of Root, Kabuto locks Sai inside. After Sai inspects the room for any sign of surveillance, he takes out two scrolls from his person and summons a Bingo Book. Kabuto remembers his Bingo Book task and realises that he left the envelope in Sai's room, and decides to head back. He begins walking down the corridor, unaware that Team Kakashi is running down an adjacent corridor looking for Sai as well. In his room, Sai begins to peruse the contents of the book and freezes as he hears the sound of his door unlock.",

  "description": "Team Kakashi enter Sai's room, with Yamato using his Wood Release: Hand Tool Manipulation technique to make his finger into a key. Sakura returns his picture book to him, which Sai appreciates. Naruto angrily questions Sai over his betrayal of the team. As his mission was to keep his agenda a secret from Team Kakashi, Sai declares his mission a failure, and since he cannot overpower the three of them at once, he decides to reveal his true mission to them. In order to gain control over Konoha, Danzō had sent him to be Orochimaru's aide, conspiring with him to destroy Konoha. Sakura remembers the loss of life the last time Orochimaru had attempted to destroy Konoha, including the death of the Third Hokage, but Sai is indifferent. Yamato explains that Sai is from Root, a special unit formed by Danzō that utilises specialised training in order to suppress emotions; he adds that the training is similar to those used in Kirigakure. Naruto remembers that that is the village where Zabuza hails from, and recalls his encounter with the famous swordsman, who revealed that Kiri's graduation exam entailed the murder of classmates in order to pass.\nSakura, however, does not believe that emotions can be suppressed completely, citing that Sai's appreciation over gaining his picture book back is proof of it. She goes on to state that his care for the book is due to the fact that is the only thing that reminds him that he has a brother whom he shared a bond with. Sai claims that there was no such bond, and adds that his name isn't even Sai; rather, he has no name and his mere existence is to serve as Danzō's tool. He does reveal that his brother isn't his actual blood brother, but merely a fellow boy he grew up with inside of Root. Yamato believes that Sai ended up murdering his brother, but Sai, with a tinge of emotion, tells them that he did not murder his brother, and that the latter succumbed to illness. Sai had been drawing his picture book to present it to him as a gift, but when his brother died, Sai did not have idea how to finish the book and suppressed any personal thoughts thereafter.\nMeanwhile, Kabuto is headed back to Sai's room in order to retrieve the envelope he left there, which contains the personnel files of Konoha's Anbu personally assigned to the Hokage Guard Platoon. However, as he unlocks the door, he finds the room empty, with no trace of the envelope. Team Kakashi, along with Sai, had relocated on the surface outside of the base. Using his Wood Release, Yamato binds Sai. Naruto states that with Sai out of the way, their mission is to save Sasuke, just like it was before. Sai is confused over his motives, and reveals that he had just met Sasuke a short while ago, and that Sasuke showed no concern for Naruto. Sai is unable to comprehend why Naruto would want to save someone who does not want to be saved, who does not reciprocate the same bond Naruto seems to share with him, especially when he is not under direct orders to do so. Naruto tells Sai that there was a time when he hated Sasuke, as Sasuke was top of the class while he himself was at the bottom. However, over time the two forged a bond, and Naruto credits Sasuke as the first person to truly accept him. Naruto claims that it is due to that bond that he will protect Sasuke, even if it means taking down Orochimaru, who Sai told them was always with Sasuke. Sai is slightly moved by Naruto's words, but remains indifferent. Naruto, however, prepares himself to go rescue Sasuke.",

  "description": "As Naruto is proclaiming that he will retrieve Sasuke, the team is ambushed by Kabuto, who had managed to locate them. He is surprised that they tracked them, but reminds himself that Yamato is one of Orochimaru's experiments after all. Naruto tells Kabuto to butt off, but when Kabuto refuses, Naruto comes rushing at him with Rasengan. When Kabuto manages to easily avoid and dispel the Rasengan, Naruto decides to attack him head on with his Shadow Clone Technique. Kabuto breaks one of Naruto's wrists and uses his Chakra Scalpel to take out the other Naruto's. Yamato uses his Wood Release to trap Kabuto, who jumps in mid-air to avoid being hit. Sakura climbs up the wood structures and attempts to hit Kabuto with her Chakra Enhanced Strength; Kabuto, who has the captured Sai in tow, manages to move out of the way, but Sakura's strike punches a hole through the rock, destroying a hornet's nest and causing the hornets to attack Kabuto.\nUsing his chakra scalpel, Kabuto strikes and defeats all of the hornets. Believing himself to be outmatched by the three shinobi, he frees Sai, whom he still trusts. Kabuto calls Naruto pathetic for continuing to go after Sasuke, claiming that as people change, Sasuke isn't the same person he once knew. Sai recalls Naruto explaining his bond with Sasuke and decides to sneak attack Kabuto from behind, restraining him. Sai explains that he would like to see the bond between Naruto and Sasuke with his own eyes; when Kabuto asks what he is doing, Sai merely repeats Kabuto's words about people being able to change.\nYamato uses his Wood Release to keep Kabuto bound while the team prepares to infiltrate the hideout once more. Kabuto reveals that by now, Sasuke would have finished his training with Orochimaru and thus is probably taking a rest in one of the rooms. Naruto and Sakura are excited to realise that Sasuke truly is inside the hideout, but before they can head out, Kabuto warns them that there are tons of empty rooms and isolated hallways, and while it is possible they may locate Sasuke, chances are they might accidentally enter Orochimaru's private chambers. Nonetheless, the team decide to take the risk and go find Sasuke, with Yamato leaving a wood clone to watch over Kabuto.\nIn the hideout, Yamato splits themselves into teams - he and Sakura on one team, and Naruto and Sai on the other. Sai agrees, and Naruto relents as he is willing to do anything to save Sasuke. The four go checking many rooms for Sasuke, but find them all empty. Naruto and Sakura each reminisce on their memories with Sasuke, and Naruto, who is running down a hallway, shouts out Sasuke's name. Sasuke, who is sleeping in a room, is awakened by the call and opens a Sharingan activated eye, only to close it a moment after.",

  "description": "As Naruto continues searching for Sasuke with Sai, he collapses, due to his body having not recovered after entering his four-tailed form earlier. As Naruto falls unconscious, Sai carries him to the side. Sakura and Yamato continue searching each rooms, with Sakura getting impatient as they find themselves unable to locate Sasuke. Yamato warns Sakura not to rush in blindly, reminding her that they are in Orochimaru's lair and that there may be traps in place. Up on the surface, the Yamato wood clone continues to watch over Kabuto, who claims that the only map of the hideout is in his mind. Yamato's wood clone refuses to take Kabuto back to the hideout, unaware that the latter has prepared a Chakra Scalpel behind his back.\nAs Naruto regains consciousness, Sai tells him that Naruto reminds him of his adoptive brother. Sai recalls his memories with his brother and finally remembers what he wanted to draw, and quickly paints a picture of his brother and him smiling and holding hands. He tells Naruto that this was their dream, and that Naruto reminds him of his brother. Their conversation is interrupted by Orochimaru, who stumbles onto them while walking down a corridor. He uses his Hidden Shadow Snake Hands technique to attack them, but the two evade. Naruto tells Sai to rescue Sasuke while he handles Orochimaru. As Sai sets off, Naruto prepares to fight the Sannin, and uses Shadow Clone Technique. Naruto's infused chakra activates the tracking seed he had swallowed, and Yamato is signalled to the crisis. With his shadow clones, Naruto attempts to fight off Orochimaru, who uses his snakes and swords to dispel the shadow clones; Naruto hit a snake with Rasengan but finds himself caught by another snake. Orochimaru wonders whether this is the strongest Naruto can be; Naruto considers tapping into the Nine-Tails' power but remembers Yamato's warning, and decides against it, not wanting to risk losing control and hurting one of his teammates. Orochimaru decides to kill Naruto, but his attack is blocked by Yamato's Wood Release.\nSai, who theorises that Naruto's bout with Orochimaru should not only take time but summon Sakura and Yamato as well, takes the opportunity to use his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to create several ink rats to find Sasuke. Orochimaru senses Sai and spares Team Kakashi's life for the time being, asking them to repay him by killing off more Akatsuki members. Sakura asks where Sai is, and Naruto tells him that Sai went off looking for Sasuke. Sakura notices that Sai left his backpack and she smiles as she realises that he finished his picture book. Yamato finds a Bingo Book among Sai's belongings, surprised that he would even have such a thing in his possession. He explains to the duo that the Bingo Book has a list of individuals who are meant to be assassinated, and that if Sai has the book, then he must be on an assassination mission. Yamato, Sakura and Naruto are then shocked to see Sasuke's face inside the Bingo Book, and realise that Sai's true mission may be assassinating Sasuke. Meanwhile, one of his Sai's rats locates Sasuke's room and Sai opens the door, seeing Sasuke lying on his side with his Uchiha Clan symbol facing the door.",

  "description": "Yamato finds Sai's Bingo Book and explains to Naruto and Sakura that Sai must have assassinated all of the people in the book with an \"X\" on their faces; they find a photo of Sasuke inside the book, and Yamato tells them that Sai's true mission was not to be the liaison between Orochimaru and Danzō, but to kill Sasuke. Yamato explains that Danzō does not want to destroy Konoha, but instead wishes to protect it, and considering Sasuke a threat, since Sasuke is to be Orochimaru's future host body, a necessity to eliminate. Naruto refuses to believe Sai would kill Sasuke, citing Sai's genuine smile when he finished his picture book. However, Sakura recalls Sai telling her (after she had flashed him a smile and punched him) that he found another use for a genuine smile and believed that a smile could diffuse a situation. The trio then set off in order to find Sai, and by extension, Sasuke.\nSai locates Sasuke's room and sends in three ink snakes. However, Sasuke wakes up, having sensed his presence. Sai explains that he was sent by Danzō to kill him, but is now here to protect the bond he shares with Naruto and bring him back to Konoha. Sasuke is irritated that he was awakened from his rest due to a bond, and Sai decides to restrain him with his snakes. Sasuke breaks free, and causes an explosion that destroys a portion of the base. Yamato senses Sai's chakra and the trio set off, running down hallways until they see light at the end. Sakura spots Sai and runs down the hallway, exiting through the make shift hole. She yanks Sai and prepares to assault him for his true mission until Sasuke calls out her name, freezing her in her place. Recognising the voice, she looks up to see Sasuke. Naruto, who hears Sasuke's voice, also coming running out. Sasuke is surprised to see Naruto and asks whether Kakashi had also tagged along. Yamato tells him that he is replacing Kakashi as the leader of Team Kakashi and that they are here to escort him back to Konoha. Sasuke scoffs at the mention of \"Team Kakashi\" and realises that Sai is his replacement, calling him weak. Sai pulls out his sword, prompting Sakura to attempt to stop him, but Sai tells them that while his true mission was to kill Sasuke, he is done following orders and will now begin to think for himself, thanks to Naruto. On top of that, while he himself does not understand their bond, he acknowledges that Naruto and Sakura would do anything to preserve that bond and that Sasuke should be able to understand it. Sasuke tells him that he did understand and acknowledge the bond, hence why he severed it. He recalls losing to Itachi when he was attempting to protect Naruto, and tells them that the only bond he has is with his brother Itachi, and that it is a bond of hatred.",

  "description": "Naruto and Sasuke recall their their last battle, and Naruto wonders why Sasuke did not kill him since he wishes to sever their friendship so badly. Sasuke states that he did not kill Naruto because he did not want to obtain power the way Itachi did, as Itachi had told him to kill his best friend in order to awaken his Mangekyō Sharingan. When Naruto claims he does not understand, Sasuke retorts that he does need to explain himself, and uses his immensely fast speed to appear in front of Naruto on the ground. He asks Naruto whether it his still his dream to be Hokage, and tells him that his years spend chasing after him would have been better spent had he trained instead. Naruto muses that he cannot be Hokage if he could not even manage to save his friend. Pulling out his sword, Sasuke tells Naruto that while he spared his life last time, he has no qualms about killing him as they no longer share a bond. He attempts to stab Naruto in the back, but the attack is blocked by Sai. Sasuke praises Sai's block but emits Chidori as a current out of his body, repelling both Naruto and Sai and knocking them out.\nSakura, remembering her vow not to be weak and be able to protect Naruto and bring Sasuke back, attempts to use her Chakra Enhanced Strength to strike Sasuke. Sasuke's Sharingan eyes predicts her movements, and he channels his Chidori into his sword, preparing to attack. Yamato attempts to block the attack with his kunai, but the sword goes through the kunai and Sasuke, criticising Yamato's block, stabs him. Naruto regains consciousness and begins to fall under the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, while the First Hokage's Necklace lies on the ground. The fox attempts to communicate with Naruto from within, telling Naruto to remove the seal and use all of its power. Naruto attempts to dismiss the fox, but the fox claims that Naruto has always used his power in his time of need and that without it, he would be weak. Before Naruto can do anything, Sasuke appears, much to his and the fox's surprise. Sasuke realises that the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox is the source of Naruto's true power and is surprised that Naruto had the spirit inside of him. The demon fox is impressed that Sasuke is able to see him inside of Naruto via his Sharingan and remarks that his physical appearance along with his kekkei genkai being much advanced than his years would belie makes him a spitting image of Madara Uchiha from the elder days. Sasuke manages to burst the demon fox's chakra, telling the fox that he does not recognise the name nor does he care. Both the fox and Naruto are astonished that Sasuke was able to suppress the tailed beast's chakra, but before subsiding, he warns Sasuke not to kill Naruto.\nIn the real world, Naruto awakens back in his normal state as Sasuke looks at him. Yamato uses his Wood Release to force Sasuke's Chidori-enhanced katana out of his torso and attempts to trap him using his Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall technique to form a wooden dome around Sasuke. Sasuke, however, breaks out of the dome, and Team Kakashi is left marvelling at Sasuke's vastly improved skills and strength.",

  "description": "Naruto asks Sasuke why he stays with Orochimaru when the Sannin simply wants his body. Sasuke tells Naruto that both he and Orochimaru were unable to defeat Itachi on their own, but if he could gain the power to kill Itachi and exact his vengeance in exchange for giving his body to Orochimaru, then that would be a price he would be willing to pay. Yamato tells Naruto and Sakura that out of consideration for them, he did not attempt to seriously attack Sasuke, but that he would now resort to those methods in order to bring Sasuke back to Konoha. Sasuke scoffs at the idea of returning to the village, telling the group that he is done with them. He drops his sword, inserting it into the ground, and performs hand signs to kill them all. As he activates chakra on his body, Orochimaru grabs his hand and tells him not to use that technique. Sasuke rudely tells him to let go of his hand, and Kabuto reprimands him for doing so. Kabuto tells Sasuke that Team Kakashi is to be spared so that they may continue to kill off Akatsuki members, and in doing so, may allow Sasuke a chance to take out Itachi. Sasuke relents, and the three disappear in flames.\nNaruto berates himself for being weak and unable to stop Sasuke again and begins to cry. Sakura, who is also tearing up, tells Naruto not to cry as crying would not save Sasuke, and that the two of them together will continue on. Sai offers to help, citing that three people would be better than two, much to Yamato's satisfaction. With their mission officially completed, the team heads back to Konoha, where they report to Tsunade. When Naruto tells her that his determination to save Sasuke is non-wavering, Tsunade tells the trio to return home and stay there until she assigns them a new mission. As they walk home, Naruto asks Sakura out on a date, but is rebuffed by her when she tells him that Tsunade said to go home. Sai is observing their bond from the back and attempts to create his own with them by waving goodbye, but the two disappear before he can do so.\nAt the Konoha Hospital, Kakashi is surprised that the team fought Sasuke. Jiraiya recaps the events of the Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission, including Naruto's ascension to his four-tailed form, his fight with Orochimaru and the team's encounter against Sasuke. After finding out that Sasuke has significantly increased in power, Kakashi sighs as he realises that Naruto will now relentlessly demand training in order to keep up. In Tsunade's office, Yamato tells her that she was right about Sai, concerning him being sent by Danzō on a secret mission of his own. He tells her that Danzō sent Sai to kill Sasuke in order to rob Orochimaru of a host body. While Tsunade claims that Danzō's actions, while crafty and hardlined, were done for the benefit of the village, Yamato gives her the envelope that Danzō had instructed Sai to give to Orochimaru, which contained the personnel files of all the Anbu members assigned to the Hokage Guard Platoon. Tsunade is outraged and orders Shizune to tighten up security while seething at the idea of Danzō's coup. Meanwhile, Sai returns to the Root headquarters and reports his mission failure to Danzō, who is surprised as Sai had never failed a mission before. Sai requests to keep his name and retain his position on Team Kakashi; as Tsunade had requested the same thing, Danzō reluctantly allows it, but not before noticing Sai's smile and reminding Sai that emotions need to be repressed as they lead only to anger and hatred. Sai remembers Sasuke's bitter emotions of hatred towards him and Itachi, but also remember Naruto's happy emotions regarding his brotherly bond with Sasuke. Sai decides to go with the latter, and returns home to paint a picture. However, before he can begin, Naruto calls him from outside his window. Sai looks out and sees the rest of the team there, ready to depart on another mission.",

  "description": "Naruto has a nightmare about his Version 2 form wreaking havoc, causing him to wake up and question his dream. Sai is in the Konoha Library reading books on how to create and forge friendships. Sakura spots him in the library and invites him to come with her and Naruto to visit Kakashi at the Konoha Hospital, stating that as a member of Team Kakashi, he should meet their leader. Naruto is sitting on some steps, musing over Sasuke's remarks about giving himself over to Orochimaru if it ensured exacting his vengeance upon Itachi. He is broken out of his reverie by Sakura, although he is irritated to see Sai. As Sakura calls Naruto a dummy, Sai remembers an excerpt from the library book that explained how friends use nicknames to breed familiarity and sustain a friendship. He asks Sakura and Naruto if he may enter their conversation, surprising them. He reveals what he was doing in the library, to their astonishment. Sakura is taken aback by his desire to form a friendship while Naruto, who did not think Sai would ever care about their friendship, tells him not to worry and to let it come naturally. Wanting to create nicknames for the two, Sai is unable to find the correct words and is told by Sakura to use personality traits as a basis. After checking Sakura out, which causes her to blushes, he smiles and calls her ugly; Naruto attempts to restrain her, but she proceeds to beat both him and Sai up.\nAs they visit Kakashi in the hospital, Kakashi notices that Naruto and Sai are bruised and wonders if the two got into a fight. Naruto attempts to tell Kakashi that they met Sasuke, but Kakashi tells them that he already knows as Yamato had debriefed him. Naruto and Sakura remark that Sasuke has gotten exceedingly strong, the latter even believing that he may be undertaking drug enhancement under Kabuto's supervision in order to accelerate his growth. Kakashi states that the team would simply have to get stronger, especially Naruto, to whom he has devised a new training strategy. When Naruto inquires about the strategy, Kakashi tells him that the two of them will be creating a brand new, unique ninjutsu technique more powerful than the Rasengan that only he would be able to use. Before they can get into the specifics, Asuma and the rest of Team 10 enter the room. Asuma wishes to speak to Kakashi in private while telling Teams 7 and 10 to enjoy a barbeque lunch on his behalf. Ino notices Sai and develops an infatuation on him; Shikamaru and Chōji also notice and remember Sai, but Sai introduces himself to them and explains the reasoning behind his attack, which was to test Naruto since they were going to be teammates. Shikamaru privately tells Naruto that Tsunade had informed him about his encounter with Sasuke, and now that the Chūnin Exams were over, he would be free to tag along the next time. He does, however, remark that Naruto has missed the exams due to his mission and therefore is still a genin.\nShikamaru excuses himself from the restaurant in order to help the Nara clan with some medicinal task, although his true motive is to join Asuma and Kakashi's conversation regarding the Akatsuki. Asuma states that word of their activities has increased outside of the village, and due to their hunt for tailed beasts, it would only be a matter of time before they reached Konoha. Shikamaru also wonders whether Naruto would be able to defend himself, seeing as Gaara, who is a Kage, lost. Kakashi states that Naruto will get strong enough in time.\nAt the restaurant, Ino sits next to Sai in an attempt to be close to him. Chōji is told by Ino to introduce himself to Sai before eating, and Sai, wanting to create a nickname for him based on personality traits, begins to call him a fatso; however, both Naruto and Sakura predict his choice of words and Naruto gets up and covers his mouth, telling Sai that fatso is not an acceptable word to call Chōji. Sai realises that certain words are not acceptable to use as nicknames, and after his incident with Sakura, believes that women do not like to be called what they look like; instead, he chooses to refer to women as the opposite of what they are. After looking at Ino, he decides to call her beautiful. Naruto sighs in relief as Sai has finally managed to compliment a girl without her beating him up, but looks to Sakura to see how she would react; Sakura, irked that Sai called her ugly but called Ino beautiful, proceeds to trash the restaurant and pounds Sai.\nOutside the village, two grave robbers ransack graves, only to claim that they haven't found whom they're looking for.",

  "description": "Naruto is standing in a field with Kakashi, excited to begin training with his old sensei again. Kakashi explains that the secret behind creating a new technique unique to Naruto would be to change the form of his chakra and then apply his chakra's nature to it. Kakashi starts off by asking Naruto to produce his Rasengan, which he does. Kakashi tells Naruto that his Rasengan is the perfect example of changing the form of chakra, as the technique literally requires the user to compress and form their chakra into a sphere. Naruto believes that since he has already accomplished half of the steps, that the rest should be easy. However, Naruto does not know what type of chakra he possesses.\nKakashi explains that there are five elemental natures that most people's chakra falls into - Fire, Wind, Earth, Water and Lightning. Kakashi decides to show an example to Naruto by explaining the concept behind his Chidori; by forming chakra in the palm of his hand, he applies his lightning nature to that chakra, thus creating a lightning-based technique. Naruto realises that Sasuke must possess two chakra types since he is able to use both fire and lightning-based techniques. Naruto wonders what type he has, and Kakashi decides to find out. Using litmus papers grown from a tree that absorbs chakra, Kakashi gives them to Naruto. He explains that a lightning nature would cause the paper to wrinkle, while wind would rip it; fire would burn it, water would make it wet, and earth would cause it to crumble. Naruto takes the paper in his hand and closes his eyes as he focuses in chakra into. After opening his eyes, he sees that the paper has torn in two, and Kakashi confirms that Naruto possesses a natural affinity for wind-natured chakra.\nYamato suddenly arrives, and Naruto asks him what chakra affinity he possesses. Yamato showcases his Earth Release: Earth-Style Rampart and his Water Release: Waterfall Basin Technique to create a waterfall, much to Naruto's admiration. He explains that he possesses both Earth and Water type chakra, and while a ninja who possesses two chakra natures can use one or the other without relative difficulty, combining the two is another story. Kakashi and Yamato explain to Naruto that the latter's Wood Release is a combination of Earth and Water. Kakashi tells Naruto that only those who possess a special kekkei genkai are able to combine two nature transformations, citing Haku and his Ice Release as an example. Naruto then questions what Yamato is doing there, and the captain explains that he is there at Kakashi's request. In order to cut down their training time significantly, Kakashi claims that Naruto must use shadow clones. Since Naruto is able to retain the shadow clone's memories and experiences after dispelling them, creating multiple shadow clones and teaching each one of them would significantly reduce Naruto's training time.\nNaruto initially believes that this is Kakashi's secret to his strength, but Kakashi claims that this would be his first time testing out his theory, since he cannot create as many shadow clones or maintain them for long like Naruto can. Naruto is surprised by this, and Kakashi tells Naruto that he is able to do so since he possesses four times more chakra than he does, adding that if he were to use the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra as well, he would have a hundred times more chakra than him. Yamato, however, reminds Naruto that by depleting his chakra, and then accessing the Nine-Tails', he may risk unleashing the fox's spirit, hence why Kakashi had requested his presence, since Yamato can suppress the tailed beast. Naruto, remembering how he had hurt Sakura while under the fox's influence, enthusiastically thanks Yamato for his help.\nNaruto creates multiple shadow clones as Kakashi gives them all a leaf, with the task of using their wind-nature chakra to tear the leaf in half. Naruto is astonished to learn that he has managed to cause a slight tear in his leaf, and Kakashi remarks that perhaps Naruto's training would not take as long as he thought.",

  "description": "Naruto continues with with his chakra nature training, with Yamato on standby, although he can only manage to cause some leaves to tear. Kakashi tells him to dispel his clones in order to gain the cumulative knowledge, but after Naruto almost faints, he also mentions that Naruto would gain cumulative fatigue. Not wanting to give up when he feels so close, Naruto uses the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to resume his training once more, this time with all the shadow clones possessing the prior knowledge and experience. Struck with a thought, Naruto asks Kakashi whether there are any other shinobi in Konoha who possess Wind Release, in order for him to ask them for advice. Kakashi tells him that he does know one person who does, who would most likely be playing shōgi at the moment.\nAt the same time, Asuma Sarutobi and Shikamaru are playing shōgi, with the winner having to pay for Team Asuma's next post-win barbecue. Asuma loses the game, but Shikamaru's victory is cut short by the arrival of Naruto, who wishes to have Asuma give him tips on wind-natured chakra. Shikamaru is in disbelief that Naruto is attempting chakra nature training, claiming it to be too difficult for Naruto to master. Asuma himself is surprised that Naruto is a wind nature type, but agrees to give advice if Naruto is willing to pick up Team Asuma's tab on their next dinner. After checking Gama-chan, his frog purse, Naruto claims he has just enough money to do so, and agrees. Asuma produces his Chakra Blades, and infuses them with his wind-type chakra. Naruto attempts to do so as well, albeit not to the same degree as Asuma's, the latter claiming that Naruto should grind his chakra against one another. Naruto questions why one would infuse their chakra into blades when the blades are already sharp as is. Asuma tells Naruto to throw the blades at the trees; when Naruto does so, it hits a tree, but Asuma's goes through the tree and penetrates a boulder. He tells Naruto that he was holding back and that he could have gone through the boulder as well. Naruto enthusiastically thanks Asuma for his advice, which Asuma promises to offer if Naruto is willing to pick the team's dinner bill. Naruto dispels himself, much to Shikamaru's surprise, revealing himself to have been nothing more than a shadow clone. Shikamaru adds that Asuma was cruel for passing on the bill to Naruto, due to Chōji Akimichi's appetite.\nIn Tsunade's office, Shizune notifies Tsunade regarding an assault on a neighbouring village in the Land of Fire, which she believes to be the work of Amegakure. Tsuande is infuriated that one of the allied nations would risk starting a war by attacking another nation and asks for Asuma's team. Shizune brings up her concern over keeping Naruto in the village in the event that it was the Akatsuki, and Tsunade decides to send him out on a D-ranked mission regarding grave robbers. Meanwhile, The Naruto shadow clone returns to the clearing and shares the advice with the other Naruto's, unaware that Sai is watching him and drawing his likeness. Naruto manages to use Asuma's advice to grind his chakra against one another, and him and his shadow clones manage to tear their leaves in two. Feeling elated at his success, Naruto dispels the clones to acquire their experience, although the combined fatigue causes him to pass out. Kakashi catches the unconscious Naruto, and Sai, along with Sakura, who had joined at the last moment, come rushing out. After asking if Naruto is alright, Sakura notifies Kakashi that the team is wanted by Tsunade.\nAt the Yamanaka flower shop, Asuma buys a bouquet of flowers, although he doesn't reveal to whom. Ino tells him to say hi to Kurenai for her, causing Asuma to go red and wonder how she found out. Shikamaru and Chōji also see Asuma step out of the store with flowers and they tell him to wish Kurenai well. Asuma asks how they know, and Shikamaru tells him that despite his efforts to hide their relationship, everybody is already aware of it. Chōji prods Shikamaru to move on to more pressing matters, and Shikamaru notifies Asuma and Ino that the entire team is being tasked to go out on a mission by Tsunade.\nTeam Asuma arrives at Tsunade's office, where the Hokage debriefs them on their mission and notifies the team that the Akatsuki may be involved. She tells them all to take great care, and dismisses them. On a rooftop, Asuma stares longingly at Kurenai, who is in her room, but decides against approaching her and instead prepares to set off with his team. They notice Naruto, Sakura, Sai and Yamato heading off on a mission as a well, with Naruto being irritated that his training was interrupted for a mission. Konohamaru and the rest of Team Ebisu pass by, having caught another cat as per their mission. He wishes Naruto and Uncle Asuma well on their mission, prompting to Naruto to wonder why Konohamaru referred to Asuma as his uncle. Shikamaru notifies him that Asuma is the Third Hokage's son and hence Konohamaru's actual uncle. Naruto is surprised to learn of this, as are Ino and Chōji. Asuma dismisses his parentage as no big deal, but Naruto tells him that he feels like he has a special bond with Asuma since they share the same chakra nature type, and that the bond is strengthened by the fact that Asuma is the son of the Third Hokage. As Team Yamato begin to depart on their mission, Asuma reminds Naruto of his advice and asks Yamato to protect Naruto.\nBack in Tsunade's office, Kakashi reports on Naruto's training methods and is given a separate mission by the Hokage. Meanwhile, a group of individuals look upon the devastating aftermath of an attacked village, stating that the Land of Fire will rise to the top once more, albeit only after Konohagakure is destroyed.",

  "description": "On their way to the Fire Temple, Team Yamato decide to stop for the night and prepare a campfire. After Yamato scares Naruto, Sakura decides to ask about their mission and why people would rob graves. Yamato reminds her of her fight with Sasori, in which the puppet master used the body of the Third Kazekage to create a puppet. He tells them that a shinobi's corpse holds a wealth of information that would be considered a gold mine by interested parties.\nThe next morning, Naruto notices leaves flying in the wind and decides to stop and practise his training. As he is hunched over, Sai notices Naruto trembling and believes that Naruto is still scared by Yamato's story the other night, when Yamato had stated that the graves could have been disturbed by the very ninja who rested in them, having returned back to life. Naruto succeeds in tearing his leaf into a perfect half, and is ecstatic about his progress. When they reach their meeting point, Yamato is unable to locate any of the monks from the Fire Temple who were supposed to meet them there. Yamato and Sakura head off to locate them while Sai and Naruto are told to wait in case any of the monks arrive. When an owl in a tree frightens Naruto, Sai consults one of his books, which states that if a friend is frightened, they should show some tenderness by putting their arm around them. Sai gets up and sits next to Naruto, and proceeds to pull him into a one-armed hug, disturbing Naruto. Sai notices Naruto's perturbed facial reaction and attempts to use his other hand as well, leaning in for a hug. Naruto breaks free and berates Sai for his actions, claiming he does not like Sai like that. Sai attempts to explain his actions to Naruto and finds an excerpt in his book about being misunderstood by a friend, but Naruto runs off, deciding to find Sakura instead.\nOn his walk, he hears rustling in a bush, and believing it to be the grave robbers, throws a shuriken at it. The rustling turns out to be the work of a boar, who proceeds to chase Naruto. Naruto manages to avoid the boar, who drops a barrier seal, and stumbles upon one of the Fire Temple's hidden tombs. After entering the tomb, he notices that the coffin is gone. His sojourn in the tomb is interrupted by Sora, a monk-in-training. Each of them believes the other to be a grave robber, and the two engage in a fight, nearly destroying the tomb. Despite Naruto using both his Shadow Clone Technique and his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the shadow clones are easily defeated by Sora's Beast Tearing Palm technique, which he channels through his Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw. Naruto recognises Sora's attack as a Wind Release technique and tries to discuss it, only for Sora to attempt to kill him. Their scuffle, however, is stopped by the other monks and the rest of Team Yamato. After clearing up their confusion, the other two monks notify Chiriku, another monk, that the coffin has indeed been stolen, and he orders them to tighten up security on the other hidden tombs. He also explains to Sora, who protests Konoha's involvement, that Konoha shinobi are needed to deal with grave robbers who are skilled enough to break through their barrier seals.\nAs the monks and Team Yamato head to the Fire Temple, Naruto attempts to ask Sora about his wind techniques, only for Sora to ignore him. Naruto becomes irked at Sora, and continues to climb up the stairs to the temple. Once he reaches the top, however, he freezes in his tracks, recognising the temple from his nightmare and claiming that he felt like he had been here before.",

  "description": "At the top of the Fire Temple, Sora trips Naruto and sends him down the flights of stairs, citing it to be \"divine retribution\". This further's Naruto's irritation towards Sora, but stops when he notices all the glares the other monks give Sora, which seems familiar to him. In the Fire Temple, monk Chiriku explains that the men whose graves were robbed were all fallen members of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, shinobi who were sworn to protect the Land of Fire's daimyō. Naruto is confused over the existence of the Guardian Ninja, wondering why they would be required to protect the Land of Fire if the shinobi of Konohagakure, a village located in the Land of Fire, are also sworn to protect it. Yamato explains that the shinobi of Konoha protect the nation as a whole with the Guardian Ninja are tasked with protecting only the daimyō, the feudal lord who is the head of the Land of Fire. He also reveals that Asuma was once one of the twelve guardians.\nNaruto and Sakura are impressed, and Chiriku hopes Asuma is still well. Chiriku divulges more about the Guardians, explaining that once long ago, all twelve were assigned to protect the daimyō; however, six of them wished to have all the neighbouring lands under the Fire Daimyō's control in the Land of Fire and attempted to invade them. Once the daimyō had caught wind of their plans, he had ordered the other six to eliminate the conspiratorial half, in which a battle ensued, leaving only Asuma and Chiriku as the survivors. Sai realises that this means that the men whose tombs were defiled and whose bodies were taken were friends and comrades of Asuma and Chiriku, thus making the issue personal for them. Sai drives his point home when he compares it to what Naruto and Sakura must feel if the same ever happened to Sasuke. Naruto gives Chiriku his word that they will apprehend the grave robbers once and for all.\nOutside the temple, the team witnesses the monks sparring, and Naruto notices that Sora is holding back. Entering the sparring match himself, Naruto and Sora begin exchanging blows, although Sora's attacks are much more forceful. Sora tells Naruto that he would bestow a new name upon the genin for the afterlife, but after noticing all the other monks staring at him, Sora becomes enraged and his attacks lose focus, allowing Naruto to easily dodge all of them; Naruto manages to land a kick in Sora's face as Chiriku ends the match. As Sora storms off, under the glare of the other monks, Naruto retreats to treat his bruise; Sai attempts to wipe his brow, an idea he picked up from his book. After Naruto asks him what Sora meant by bestowing a name for the afterlife, he interprets it as a friendly nickname and heads off to find Sora.\nHe finds Sora practising his Beast Tearing Gale Palm technique, cracking boulders and nearly collapsing the cave. Naruto inquires him over his usage of Wind Release, and Sora retaliates by attempting to hit Naruto; Naruto easily avoids and blocks all of Sora's moves. Sora asks whether Naruto was always this annoying, and Naruto responds that people always thought so; he also deduces, based on the glares Sora gets, that Sora must also feel the same. Sora admits that nobody likes him, but that out of everyone, he dislikes himself the most. He blames it on a hidden power he possesses inside of him, one that he believes he cannot get rid of but needs in order to avenge his father's murder. Before he can continue on any further, he notices a patrol bird from one of the hidden tombs and he, along with Naruto, return to the temple. There, Chiriku notifies them that another tomb has been broken into, and Team Yamato, along with Sora, head towards another tomb to prevent the next attack. After they leave, the grave robbers arrive at the Fire Temple.",

  "description": "Yamato sends a message from the Fire Temple back to Konoha, where Shizune reports its contents to Tsunade. She ponders over the latest string of events - the grave robberies of three of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, the Akatsuki's plans, Orochimaru supposedly returning to hiding following his encounter against Team Yamato and finally, Danzō Shimura himself, a village elder who is attempting to overthrow the current regime. Wanting to deal with the internal affairs first, Tsunade has Shizune dispatch Anbu members not affiliated with Root to observe Danzō at all times. At home, Danzō muses over Sai's request to stay on Team Kakashi, but before he can give it anymore thought, he senses the presence of the Anbu. Wondering what Tsunade is up to, he tells himself not to worry as he holds all the cards in his favour.\nIn the woods near the Fire Temple, Chiriku tells Yamato that the coffins must be heavy and that the only escape route is to the south. When they reach a valley, they notice the four coffins moving through the ground. Fearing it may be a trap, Yamato tells Chiriku to stay behind while the rest apprehend the coffins. Pairing Sai with Sakura and Sora with Naruto, the five pursue the coffins. As Naruto and Sora fight amongst each other to lead the mission, the coffins begin to go underground. Elsewhere, Furido, the man behind the operation, orders his four-man team to deal with the ones following the coffins. Using her scroll as a medium for her terrain-altering technique, Fuen draws out a new terrain filled with traps. Her terrain design is brought to life by Fudō, using his Earth Release: Mutability technique. As Team Yamato and Sora were confined within a maze riddled with traps, they were then each separated. Sakura and Sora went off to look for Naruto, who had nearly avoided being crushed by a rolling boulder. He is then faced by Fūka, who blames the trap evasion as a mistake on Fuen's part. Yamato uses his Wood Release to avoid being buried alive, but finds himself face-to-face with Fudō, the latter being impressed over his Wood Release ability. Coating himself with Rock Armour, he attempts to use his Chakra Enhanced Strength to kill Yamato, who manages to avoid the strike. Meanwhile, Sai is riding his giant ink bird in an effort to escape the maze, only to be stopped by Fuen, who manages to place a tracking device on Sai.",

  "description": "In Konoha, Tsunade is notified by Shizune that they have received a letter from the Fire Temple, stating that Team Yamato had been ambushed. Elsewhere in the village, Danzō Shimura is aware of the Anbu observing him at all times, placed under supervision by Tsunade herself.\nNear the Fire Temple, Fudō, with his Rock Armour, is seemingly invincible, avoiding all of Yamato's Wood Release and kunai equipped with explosive tags. Using his Earth Release: Bedrock Coffin technique, he seemingly entombs Yamato. Commending Yamato's worthiness, Fudō brands the coffin with the insignia of Konoha before departing, unaware that Yamato used his Earth Release to merge with the coffin. Yamato escapes, and theorises whether the ambush was just to attack one of them, wondering if Danzō may have been behind it.\nSai, who is engaged by Fuen, refuses to fight on a terrain designed by an enemy and flees using his Ink Mist Technique. Unaware that Fuen had thrown a tracking device on his backpack, his attempts to navigate the maze is halted by Fuen's Altering Terrain Diagram Scroll, which notifies her of his exact presence. Using her Altering Terrain Technique, she plants traps that nearly kill him. Not wanting to toy with her prey for too long, she decides to finish him off with Earth Release: Rock Section Cane, forming spears made of stone. She uses one of these spears to impale Sai, but using an ink-variant of the Body Replacement Technique, he reappears behind her, leaving his tracking chip behind. Using his Super Beast Imitating Drawing, he creates three ink beasts to go after her. While she easily defeats them with her stone spears, Sai uses the opportunity to disappear.\nNaruto is approached by Fūka, who offers to kiss him in either the French or traditional way. Naruto refuses to kiss what he deems an easy girl; when asked whether he had been kissed before, Naruto vehemently protests that he had, although he admits that it was to a guy, recalling his first and only kiss to none other than Sasuke. Fūka licks Naruto's cheek, and after tasting his wind type chakra, which she deems rare, wishes to add it to her collection. She kisses Naruto in an attempt to drain his chakra, but the latter dispels himself, revealing himself to be nothing more than a shadow clone. He creates more shadow clones and praises Fūka's soft lips, although he adds that she won't be able to kiss him again. Using Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique, she burns and dispels of all his shadow clones. When he creates more, she resorts to using Water Release: Snake's Mouth technique to twist and swallow them all up, dispelling all of the clones. With no more clones left, Naruto is left exposed, dragged through the water's current as he marvels at Fūka's possession of two types of elemental chakra natures. Fūka responds in kind by using Lightning Release: Electromagnetic Murder to send a powerful jolt of electricity through the water. Before he is shocked, he expresses shock at her ability to possess not one or two but three different types of chakra natures.\nFudō and Fuen meet up at the top of the terrain, where Fudō proudly exclaims that he killed his foe. Fuen admits that she did not manage to do the same, but chalks it up to Sai being much more of a challenge than she anticipated. Inside the maze, Sakura, who was abandoned by Sora, is nearly attacked by a giant spider until she is saved by Sai, who uses his ink to blind the spider; the spider retaliates by shooting outs its venom, poisoning Sai. Sai asks Sakura if she touched by his move; pulling out a book on self-sacrifice, he reads out an excerpt that states that one of the best ways to touch other people is to give up your life for them, and that it works especially well with women. Sakura is irked by the comment, while Sai wonders whether the move would work on swaying Naruto. Sakura then jabs Sai with a needle containing antidote, as Sai shrieks in pain. Meanwhile, Sora manages to catch up to the mastermind orchestrating the attacks, Furido, who tells Sora that he has been waiting for him.",

  "description": "Furido tells Sora that he had been waiting for him and offers him a baked potato. However, after smelling the soil of the hidden tombs in the breeze, he discovers that Furido is one of the grave robbers and attempts to attack, although he is easily overpowered by Furido. Using a Five Elements Unseal, he unlocks Sora's true power, causing Sora's bandaged right arm to transform into a monstrous limb. Sora attempts to defeat Furido using an enhanced version of his Beast Tearing Gale Palm, but the attack is blocked by Furido's wind twister.\nMeanwhile, Fūka attempts to kiss Naruto once more, although he proves to be nothing more than a shadow clone. The real Naruto attempts to hit her from behind with Rasengan, but she counters the attack with her scattering flower technique, which causes a cyclone of flowers powered by wind type chakra to hit Naruto and dispel his Rasengan. Naruto is surprised to discover that she is able to use all five of the elemental chakra types. She tells Naruto that he is still a boy, unaware of the mysterious of women, and attempts to hit him with Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique, Water Release: Snake's Mouth and Lightning Release: Electromagnetic Murder. Naruto avoids all her attacks, and Fūka resorts to using another one of her wind techniques - Spiralling Wind Ball. Naruto barely manages to avoid her attacks, and Fūka uses the opportunity to corner Naruto and use her scattering flower cyclone technique once more. Naruto creates a chain of shadow clones and has the last one cut off Fūka's hair with a kunai. Angered that Naruto damaged what Fūka perceives as the most important part of a woman, she freezes him in place with paralysis and performs her Execution by Kiss technique.\nSakura and Sai are on their way to find Naruto and Sora, but the latter is forced to stop due to the poison in his system. He tells Sakura that he is showing weakness, which he read in a book would further bonds. Sakura is irritated by his constant reading of books and tells him that certain things are to be experienced first hand. She and Sai then continue their pursuit and locate Naruto; Sakura is angered to see Naruto engaged in a kiss, exclaiming that it isn't the time for him to do such a thing, but Sai tells her something's not right. Sakura tries to attack Fūka, but she was counter-attacked by the latter and was caught by Yamato, who also searches for them. Before Yamato can break Fūka's technique, Fudō and Fuen arrive, and the former uses his Rock Pillar Prison Technique to trap the three, preventing them from interfering.\nOutside, Furido explains to Sora that the four corpses he stole would be used for the welfare of the Land of Fire, and prompts him to use his power to do the same. In order to sway him, Furido reveals that he held Sora once as a baby and that he also knew Sora's father. Before Sora can delve into the matter, he is wracked by a vision of Naruto in pain and an image of the Nine-Tails. Believing his psychic mental connection to be Naruto's cry for help, Sora leaves Furido to find Naruto. Back in the cave, Fūka continues to siphon Naruto's chakra; however, she ends up ingesting some of the Nine-Tails' malevolent chakra, the taste of the tailed beast's chakra breaking the technique. As the three grave robbers prepare to take Naruto out, he is backed up by Sora, who arrives to give Naruto a hand. Before they can engage in combat, the cave's roof is blasted open by Chiriku and the rest of the monks, who offer their assistance. The three and Furido then decide to retreat, claiming they have stalled for enough time.\nBack at the Fire Temple, Yamato tells Chiriku that Team Yamato would be heading back to Konoha in order to gain further instructions from their Hokage. Due to Sai's injury, he requests Sora to temporarily join the team.",

  "description": "Team Asuma returns to Konoha from their mission, with Asuma reporting to Tsunade that various villages in border towns located in the Land of Fire have been destroyed, with only an insignia of Amegakure left. Tsunade theorises that the massacres might be a false flag attack meant to incite a war or a response from the Fire Daimyō himself; she then tells Team Asuma to remain on standby for further instructions. Shizune recalls that Asuma was one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja tasked to protect the daimyō. As Asuma leaves, Yamato enters, ready to give his mission report. Yamato notifies Tsunade that the defiled tombs contained the corpses of four of the Guardian Ninja, and Shizune believes that the techniques those ninja possessed may be confined within their corpses. Yamato also reports that due to Sai's injuries, he has taken Sora from the Fire Temple as his replacement. He also adds that Chiriku, a head monk, was not the target of their attacks, leaving Naruto or Sora as their intended target.\nOutside, Asuma sees Team Yamato, and seems to recognises Sora. Sakura and Naruto berate Sora for his rudeness towards Asuma and warn him not to do the same to Tsunade. However, mere seconds after they enter her office, Tsunade kicks Sora out of her office, destroying the door and the wall, attempting to pummel him for insulting her; Asuma mentally remarks that it has been a long while since he had seen Sora. As they exit her office, Sakura takes Sai to the hospital, telling Naruto to stick with Sora. Sora, however, rebuffs his companionship, stating that he would take over the village in no time. Naruto heeds his words moments too late, and attempts to find and stop him. By the time he does, he finds Sora locked into a staredown with Akamaru, the latter having barked at Sora suspiciously. Naruto sighs in relief that Kiba himself is not there, only for Kiba to appear. Sora asks Kiba to keep Akamaru on a leash and to teach him to not bark at strangers. The insinuation that Akamaru is a pet angers Kiba, and the pair get into a scuffle. Chōji and Shikamaru arrive, with Chōji telling the two to get along. However, after Sora calls him fat, Chōji enters the battle himself.\nDue to the fact that Sora is a member of their team, Naruto does not feel right leaving Sora to fight two opponents at once and attempts to back Sora up. Sora does not want Naruto involved, but is slightly touched when Naruto says that he is doing so only because he sees Sora as his comrade. Rock Lee, who witnesses the fisticuffs between the four, views it as a bout of friendship and inserts himself in the fight as well. Shikamaru sighs in disbelief as he witnesses the scene, and tells Asuma, who had just arrived, that he was not into such childish things. Sora unleashes his Beast Tearing Palm while Kiba transforms Akamaru into his Beast Human Clone while he himself uses his Four Legs Technique; Lee prepares his Leaf Great Whirlwind while Naruto uses Shadow Clone Technique, followed by Chōji, who jumps into the air and uses his Multi-Size Technique. Wanting to end the fight, Asuma stops their attacks with his mere hands while Shikamaru freezes them in place with his Shadow Imitation Technique; however, Chōji, who was mid-air, is unaffected by it and ends up hitting Shikamaru in the face. Asuma then tells the team to go have some barbecue after their bout. Sora attempts to refuse the invitation by claiming that he is not hungry, but his grumbling stomach betrays him.\nAt Yakiniku Q, Sora attempts to ask Asuma if he knew Kazuma, his father. Asuma attempts to steer the conversation in another way, and Naruto takes the opportunity to ask Asuma to teach Sora his technique, since all three of them possess Wind Release. In the woods, Asuma unveils his chakra blades and, infusing his chakra with his wind nature, has his blades go through a tree and strike the boulder behind it. Using their kunai, Naruto and Sora decide to attempt the same thing. Outside the village, Furido and his team decide to attack another village, one housing the Kohaku Clan, with Furido stating that their deaths would be a great sacrifice as it would benefit the Land of Fire as a whole.",

  "description": "Yamato attempts to teach Naruto, Sakura and Sora new team formation techniques due to the fact that they are now a team. Naruto and Sora do not wish to waste time learning team formations when they would rather use their time to continue their Nature Transformation training. However, Naruto asks Yamato regarding the five elements and asks whether it would be possible for him to learn a secondary type, such as Water Release, by the time he became Jōnin. Yamato explains that one does not learn new chakra types, but must be born with the affinity to use it; however, their dominant affinity would make the other types significantly weaker. Naruto asks how one who possesses all five would be able to use them successfully, to which Yamato tells them that there has never been a shinobi who has possessed all five. This leaves Naruto to muse how Fūka was able to do so, but his thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Asuma. Interrupting their session, he reminds Yamato that Sora would not remain a member of Team Kakashi for long, and therefore learning team formations would be useless. On top of that, neither Naruto nor Sora would actually take the time to learn and utilise the formation, as they both possess strong techniques and would rather enter a battle headfirst, and instead advises Sakura and Yamato to back them up. With that in mind, Yamato calls off their formation training session, although he reminds Naruto and Sora that Asuma is on standby and thus is free to take over their nature transformation training, much to the latter's chagrin.\nin Tsunade's office, she alerts Yamato to a message she had received from Chiriku, notifying them about a secret regarding Sora. About a decade ago, Sora had unleashed some mysterious power that nearly destroyed the Fire Temple, wounding many monks. While he was subjected to medical tests, the cause of his true power was undetected and the temple kept the boy under constant surveillance. However, Sora never had another episode. Despite that, those who witnessed the attack despises Sora, hence Sora's feelings of the Fire Temple not being his true home. Chiriku had found the matter important to share with Tsunade, and Yamato remarks on the further coincidences that both Sora and Naruto share.\nIn the woods, Asuma watches over Naruto and Sora attempting to master their Wind Release ability. After a few hours, he tells the two that they should continue their training tomorrow as it is getting late, but the two believe that Asuma would be training them again the next day and rejoice. The next day, Naruto and Sora continue using their kunai to destroy a tree. Asuma is surprised that the two are able to create their current level of damage without using chakra blades, further demonstrating the pair's strength. Asuma performs the same technique with a kunai; it punctures the tree but does not create a hole around it. He tells the two to concentrate on their wind chakra instead of distracting themselves with the idea of destroying the tree. As he marvels on the duo's stamina levels, he notices Sora's backpack. He then calls for a lunch break and treats the two at Ramen Ichiraku. As Naruto rushes off after lunch to resume training, Asuma pulls Sora aside and presents the latter's Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw, which Asuma had reforged with the same metal as his trench knives. Sora does not thank Asuma and runs out after Asuma claims he does not have time to oversee their training any longer. Asuma recalls how it was he who killed Sora's father, Kazuma, after Kazuma decided to murder the Hokage in an attempt to bring all of the neighbouring lands under the control of the Fire Daimyō. His thoughts are interrupted by Kurenai, who is able to tell that there is something bothering him due to the recent increase in his smoking habits, suggesting that he should quit.\nMeanwhile, Tsunade is notified that Danzō Shimura has somehow escaped, managing to slip away from the Anbu sent to keep him under watch. Strolling through the village, Sora sees a father and son, who after buying food, reminds his son to thank him. Sora recalls Asuma repairing his claws and the fact that he did not thank Asuma. Naruto locates Sora from a bridge, but he is not the only one who has found Sora; Furido, the mastermind behind the grave robberies, has managed to track Sora to Konohagakure. He ambushes Sora when the monk-in-training is alone, and reminds him to use his hidden power for the greater good of the Land of Fire. Giving Sora two king pieces from a shōgi set, he reveals to Sora that it was Asuma who had killed his father.\nFollowing this reveal, Sora retreats to the woods, where he is joined by Naruto. Rejecting Naruto's attempts at conversation, Sora channels his anger into his chakra and throws his kunai at a tree, causing the kunai to go through it and shatter the boulder behind it.",

  "description": "Danzō is caught by the Anbu meeting with an Amegakure ninja in the woods. Both of them are chained and brought back to Konohagakure in order to be interrogated by Tsunade. At the Konoha Hospital, Naruto visits Sai, reading his books while Sai repeats Sakura's advice about gaining real-life experiences. Looking out the window, Sai is stunned when he spots Danzō being detained and brought into the village. As Danzō and the spy, Tatsuji, are brought into a secret meeting place, Tsunade summons Asuma and Yamato to the meeting as well. Sora, who was tailing Asuma, follows him to the meeting and hides in the rafters.\nTsunade asks Danzō to explain himself, asking why he would meet with an Ame-nin when tensions are so high after Amegakure was suspected of being responsible for attacking numerous villages. Danzō states that Tsunade is incompetent as Hokage if she did not even know that Amegakure were not the culprits. Yamato reveals that he recognises Tatsuji as a member of the Anbu that went missing on a mission years ago. Tsunade moves on to Tatsuji, bringing in Ibiki Morino to torture him until he gave up information. However, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane, the village elders and members of the Konoha Council, state that Tatsuji was a spy sent by Danzō into Amegakure and that he was not only reporting information back to him, but to them as well. In an attempt to make Tsunade look inept, Danzō takes the opportunity to discuss the grave robberies near the Fire Temple and how Tsunade welcomed Sora to the village with open arms, despite Sora possessing a dangerous power that nearly destroyed the temple. When Koharu states that Sora should be kept under lock and key, Danzō states the best thing to do would be to eliminate him, unaware that Sora himself is eavesdropping from the rafters. However, Yūgao Uzuki and another Anbu member locate him and bring him down to Tsunade's attention.\nSora vehemently protests against his capture, blaming Tsunade and Konoha for wanting to kill him due to the power he possesses within him and citing his own fault for trusting Yamato, his team, and the village itself. He then asks Asuma if he had killed Kazuma, and Asuma bluntly reveals that he did. Manifesting his chakra and transforming his right hand into a monstrous limb, Sora knocks out the Anbu members holding him and attempts to attack Asuma, who blocks the former's Beast Tearing Gale Palm with his chakra blades. Their bout destroys the wall, and the fight continues outside. The destruction of the wall sends a plume of smoke into the sky, which Naruto notices. Asuma manages to kick Sora into a wall, but when Sora attempts to get back up and attack again, his arm transforms back into normal. An Anbu member decides to take the opportunity to kill Sora with shuriken, but Naruto leaps in front of its path. When Sora blames Naruto for butting in, Naruto recalls Sora having his back in the cave, and repeats Sora's words. Asuma notices that the Anbu member who tried to kill Sora is from Root, but before anybody is able to interfere, Sora is whisked away by Furido. Naruto then faints from having shuriken embedded in his back.\nIn the hospital, Naruto has a nightmare about the monks of the Fire Temple attempting to seal a tailed beast's chakra, although to no avail. As the jinchūriki in his dream destroys the Iron Walls of the temple, he seems a glimpse of the Nine-Tailed Fox; Naruto then wakes up. Meanwhile, Shikamaru, Chōji and Kiba are tasked with locating Sora. On the outskirts of the village, Furido explains to Sora that the Land of Fire could not have two great kings, equal with power; hence, Kazuma, Sora's father, attempted to unite both great kings, the Fire Daimyō and Konoha's Hokage. However, his plan was failed by Asuma, who stood with his Hokage. Furido explains that Kazuma's ultimate goal was for the welfare of the Land of Fire, and that it was he who bestowed Sora's power to him. He asks Sora to help him fulfil Kazuma's wish, and in doing so, he would grant Sora as many opportunities as possible for settling the score with Asuma.\nDischarged from the hospital, Naruto goes on a walk with Sakura, with the latter expressing her marvel over Naruto's healing abilities. As the two split up, Naruto senses Sora's negative emotions and malevolent chakra. He senses Sora near Tsunade's office, and heads in that direction. In her office, Tsunade puts down a pen and prepares to sit back and relax as a projectile is headed her way. Before she can be killed, Naruto barges into her office and tackles her, saving her life. Sora jumps in through the window and attempts to use his monstrous arm to finish the job, but is impeded by Naruto. As Shizune and two Anbu members enter the room, Sora flees through the open window with Naruto in pursuit.",

  "description": "Sakura wanders the streets looking for Naruto when she manages to spot him pursuing Sora. Konohagakure suffers a power outage and Tsunade, fearing that it is a sabotaged effort as she hears no reply from the power station, moves the village to a Stage Two security threat. Sakura reports to Tsunade's office where she discovers that Sora attacked her, and is told to do her duty as a Medical-nin and heal the wounded.\nFurido and his team begin their infiltration of the village, with Fudō using his Earth Release: Rock Lodging Destruction technique to trap and kill many Konoha-nin in caves. Shizune reports to Tsunade that the village is indeed under attack; Tsunade summons the Chūnin and Jōnin of the village and alert them that the village is now under a Stage One level. She sends the squads to different points around the village and notifies Asuma that Sora tried to kill her and that he is being tailed by Naruto. Asuma then sets off to find the two.\nAt the main gate, Fuen uses her Altering Terrain Diagram Scroll to perform her Barrier Gate Five Seals Technique: Castle Closing Eight Gates, which causes four giant gates to be formed at the north, south, east and west gate. The erected barrier allows herself, Furido, Fudō and Fūka to enter or exit as they please while trapping the villagers within the confines of the barrier. Ebisu notices the barrier and appoints Team Ebisu with their first A-rank mission - evacuating the citizens from the village and into a safe haven. Furido tells the shinobi of Konoha that there can only be one king in the Land of Fire, and that the true king is none other than the Fire Daimyō. To that extent, he is prepared to wipe out the Hokage, knowing fully well that the shinobi of Konoha would die in the process. Using Fudō's Earth Release: Mutability to create a large amount of rock to hover over the main gate, Furido and Fudō use Earth Release Resurrection Technique: Corpse Soil to reanimate the dead corpses of shinobi and pit them against those from Konoha.\nMeanwhile, Naruto manages to catch up with Sora, wondering why he would attack Tsunade. Sora tells him that Tsunade tried to kill him, so he attempted to do the same before she could finish the job. Naruto is unable to believe that she would do such a thing, and their bout is interrupted by the arrival of Asuma. When Asuma asks the same question, Sora responds that he was just trying to take down Konoha's king; his usage of the word \"king\" reminds Asuma of Kazuma's exact words. He tells Sora and Naruto that whomever is attacking the village right now will not just kill Tsunade, but destroy the entire village. Asuma then leaves to join the fight at the border while Sora, not understanding his motives any more, flees; Naruto follows Sora at Asuma's bequest.\nAt the power station, the electricity is siphoned to charge the coffins containing the four Guardian Ninja.",

Shikamaru, meanwhile, is in a meeting with Tsunade and Shizune discussing defensive countermeasures. Asuma tells Team Ebisu to send any shinobi of chūnin rank or higher to the power station, and heads off in that direction. When he arrives there, he finds the reanimated corpses of Kitane, Nauma, Tōu and Seito, the four strongest members of the Twelve Guardian Ninja. Unlike the members of the Kohaku clan, these four have been reanimated completely, along with their original personalities and abilities, albeit forced to obey their caster's commands. Yamato and Sakura join Asuma at the power station and Asuma tells them that the four are attempting to use Limelight, a technique that causes complete destruction within a contained radius. He tells them that all four of them need to be in north, south, east and west positions and to prevent at least one of them from reaching their direction. In the meantime, he promises to deal with Kitane.\nNaruto manages to catch up to Sora, asking why Sora would try to kill Tsunade and why he is aligned with those who are attacking the village. Sora tells Naruto that he simply wanted to take down Konoha's Hokage due to the fact that he believes it was the Third Hokage who told his son Asuma to kill Kazuma, Sora's father. Sora decides to flee once more, but before Naruto can pursue him, he is blocked by Fūka, who wishes to pick up where they left off. Fuen traps Sakura, but shows disdain in trapping a female and asks where Sai is; Fudō manages to ensnare Yamato, and after coating himself with his Rock Armour, hits the captain with his Chakra Enhanced Strength.\nOn the outskirts of the village, Sora finds Furido, who confirms that Konoha will be burned down for the benefit of the Land of Fire, much to Sora's horror.",

  "description": "The Konoha shinobi continue to defend the main border against the reanimated corpse army besieged upon them. Although the corpses are not too difficult to defeat, the sheer number of their forces makes the shinobi's tasks more arduous. Meanwhile, Naruto is still engaged in combat with Fūka, who offers to spare his life if he gives her his body. Naruto, hanging off a roof, refuses, and thus she uses her Lightning Release: Lightning Rod technique to shock Naruto and cause him to fall to his presumed death. Naruto manages to save himself using his Shadow Clone Technique and tells her that he does not have time for her at the moment. She responds by using her Earth Release: Mud Spore combined with her Water Release: Snake's Mouth to create a mudslide that crashes into Naruto and wipes him off the roof.\nDown below, Sakura is trapped in a cave by Fuen. After touching the walls, she comes into contact with poison moths that surround her body. She wakes up on the ground with Naruto leaning over her; however, \"Naruto\" tries to stab her with a kunai. As she runs away, the Naruto's split into three and one of them seemingly stabs her. Fuen then releases her genjutsu and prepares to finish off the unconscious Sakura, only for Sakura to use a Body Replacement Technique. Using her Chakra Enhanced Strength, she punches Fuen and sends her flying through a tree. She explains how she remember Fuen's use of poison before finishing off an enemy, as opposed to facing them head on, and thus prepared herself by using an antidote. Standing above the fallen Fuen, Sakura builds up chakra into her fist and strikes her in the abdomen, killing her. As Fuen cast the Barrier Gate Five Seals Technique: Castle Closing Eight Gates, her death causes the barriers around Konoha to recede.\nIn Tsunade's office, Shikamaru tells her that he cannot come up with a countermeasure without being on the front lines. Coming across Ino, the pair head to the main gates, where they overhear Chōji telling the others that whoever defeated the barrier caster had done their job, and now it was time to do theirs. After asking everyone if they had enough chakra, Shikamaru formulates a strategy to defeat the reanimated corpses quickly.\nBack at the power station, Kitane traps Asuma with his Lightning Release: Thunder Binding in order to prevent Asuma's interference without killing him. Asuma is unable to get out of the lightning trap due to the electricity that flows through the walls. In another part of the village, Yamato is avoiding being struck by Fudō. Using his Rock Armour, Fudō tries to strike Yamato, only for Yamato to keep evading. Yamato uses his Earth Release: Earth Flow Spears to create spikes to skewer Fudō, but the latter merely punches them away. Using Fudō to soften the terrain, Yamato then uses his Water Release: Tearing Torrent to create a powerful current of water that causes the soft ground beneath Fudō to swallow him up. As he struggles to get free, Yamato uses his Wood Release: Tree Bind Flourishing Burial to constrict and squeeze Fudō to death.\nAt the main gate, Shikamaru has Chōji use his Multi-Size Technique followed by his Human Bullet Tank technique to roll over and destroy some of the reanimated corpses. He then has Lee use his taijutsu to create a powerful whirlwind that sucks in the corpses, and prepares to have Kiba and Akamaru use their Fang Passing Fang to take out the rest. However, to their surprise, the corpses all turn into dust, as Fudō, their caster, had just been killed.\nOn the outskirts of the village, Furido tells Sora that everyone in Konoha must die as they are all loyal to their king, the Hokage. Sora puts his Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw against Furido's throat in an attempt to protect the village, but Furido dodges the move and uses his cane to pull Sora down to ground level. Berating Sora for showing weakness towards Konoha for showing him compassion, he proceeds to beat Sora with his cane.",

The impact of the Rasengan seemingly destroys her body, but a withered Fūka survives. Using her Colour Course Change ability once more, she seems to regenerate her body back to her youthful state. Naruto throws a kunai at her, which she dodges easily; however, a shadow clone behind her throws his kunai as well, which slices her hair. Entering into an angered state, she dispels the shadow clone with her Earth Release: Rock Pillar Spears technique and attempts to finish the real Naruto off with her Water Release: Stormy Blockade, which summons a massive amount of water.\nThe water dispels all of the other Naruto shadow clones, leaving only the real one. Naruto jumps out of the way to escape her Lightning Release techniques, but is confused when she retaliates with her Earth Release: Mud Spore to create a mudslide once more. He correctly deduces that the reason she is using Earth Release now as opposed to Lightning is because she must be using different bodies, each body having a different chakra affinity. After he had cut her, she had switched to another body that possessed Earth instead of Lightning, explaining the difference in technique and the \"healing\" of her wounds. Surprised at his deduction, she claims that his knowledge won't do him much now and that she must kill him, as she cannot let him live to reveal her secret. As she kisses him in order to steal his Wind Release chakra as well as his body, Naruto reflects on how she does not seem to care about the damage to her bodies as she does about her hair. Figuring out her weakness, he grabs her hair and rips off a chunk. Infuriated, she attempts to bind him with her hair, but remembering his wind chakra leaf training, he uses his mere palms to tear her hair off her body. As her body withers away, leaving just a mop of hair floating above, the latter encasing her soul, Fūka rushes towards Naruto; the genin counters by creating a shadow clone and hitting the soul-contained hair with his Rasengan, destroying the soul housed within and killing Fūka.\nMeanwhile at the power station, Asuma uses his chakra blades to use his Wind Release: Verdant Mountain Gale to slice through the Lightning Release: Thunder Binding that was holding him prisoner. He manages to track down Kitane and fatally wound him before the latter could perform his Limelight ability. On the outskirts of the village, Furido tells Sora the tale of the Nine-Tailed Fox and its attack on Konoha nearly 15 years ago, and how the Fourth Hokage sealed the fox's spirit in a baby to give Konoha its jinchūriki. He reveals that some of the demon fox's chakra was harnessed by a third party and after five years sealed into a young child, none other than Sora, thus making Sora a pseudo-jinchūriki. As Furido notices that Kitane has died, he ends the jutsu on the other three, killing them off once more. He then uses his Five Elements Unseal to release the remnants of the fox spirit within Sora. Naruto, who had formed a brief mental connection with Sora earlier, heads in his direction and is shocked to see the fox's chakra above the treetops. Asuma, who had theorised that Sora would be used in an attack, also heads towards the same direction.",

  "description": "Naruto and Asuma arrive just in time to witness Sora giving in to the nature of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Asuma realises that Furido is none other than Sora's father, Kazuma, whom he thought he had killed years ago. Kazuma explains to Naruto that some of the Nine-Tails' leaked chakra was sealed and suppressed inside of Sora, but now that the seal had been removed, the fox's chakra was taking over Sora's body, all part of Kazuma's plan to sic a miniature Nine-tails' on Konoha. Sakura and Yamato arrive as well, surprised to see Sora possessing the Nine-Tails' Cloak. As Asuma and Kazuma begin their bout, Naruto attempts to sympathise with Sora, who uses his roar towards Sakura. Naruto protects Sakura, telling Sora that he had once used the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox to hurt Sakura and that he wouldn't allow the same to happen again. Using his Wood Release, Yamato binds Sora, although he is unable to suppress his chakra due to Sora not possessing the First Hokage's Necklace. Sora enters into his one-tailed form, but Team Asuma arrives at the nick of time, with Shikamaru using his Shadow Imitation Technique to trap Sora in place. He has Chōji use his Partial Multi-Size Technique to grab a hold onto Sora. Naruto tells Sora that he cannot allow Sora to use their power for evil. When Sora asks what he means, Naruto explains that he is the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Fox.\nSora does not believe him, as he claims those with tailed beast spirits within them are meant to be outcasts for life, and questions how Naruto could have friends. Naruto explains that when he was younger he was just like Sora, receiving the hateful, angry glares from adults; however, he had always pulled stunts for attention to distract himself from his loneliness and in the process ended up making friends. When Sora cries that he never had any friends, Naruto tells him that he and the others are his friends. Ino uses her Mind Body Switch Technique on Sora, but Sora gives in to the fox spirit within him, causing Ino pain and dispelling her. The burning sensation caused by the fox's chakra burns Chōji's arms, and Shikamaru's chakra runs out, freeing Sora. Sora then succumbs to his rage and enters into his three-tailed form.",

  "description": "As Asuma and Kazuma continue their bout, Sora continues to fight against the Konoha shinobi in his three-tailed form. Naruto attempts to stop him, but the anger and hatred of the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra sealed within Sora resonates with the real fox sealed inside Naruto, causing Naruto to instantly transform into his one-tailed form. Yamato attempts to use his Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands to suppress Naruto's transformation, but to no avail, as it is Sora's chakra that is causing Naruto's transformation. Naruto attempts to fight against his transformation, but after Sora continues to attack him, Naruto sprouts two extra tails and enters his third-tailed form as well.\nDuring their battle, Kazuma proudly thanks Sora for awakening Naruto's spirit, claiming that the real demon fox will now destroy Konohagakure. When Asuma questions his motives, Kazuma explains that they are mere pawns meant to serve their king, and that he would do anything for that cause, even transform his son into a mere weapon of mass destruction.\nSora's skin begins to burn off as he enters into his four-tailed form. Naruto's skin begins to do the same, but Naruto attempts to prevent the transformation with his willpower, berating the fox for attempting to come out when not called upon. Desperate to halt his transformation, Naruto uses one of the severed claws from Sora's Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw to stab himself in the leg, his pain overriding the negative emotions spurring the fox on. Naruto's transformation subsides and he returns to normal, although Sora remains in his four-tailed form. The sight of Naruto stabbing himself awakens a part of Sora inside his four-tailed form, where he contemplates on his being alone, watched on by adults who despise him. He then hears the sound of Naruto's voice calling out to him.",

  "description": "After seeing Sora in his four-tailed form, Kazuma states that his job is done and attempts to flee, but is pursued by Asuma. In the woods, Asuma attempts to strike Kazuma, only for the latter to keep evading. However, Kazuma is stealthily bound by three ink snakes, created by Sai, who had left the hospital when he heard the commotion in the village. Kazuma breaks out of Sai's binds and attempts to rush at Asuma, but Asuma stabs him with his chakra blades. As Kazuma dies, Asuma spots his white Land of Fire sash, recalling Sora's words about how the only thing he could remember about his father was his spotless white sash.\nMeanwhile, Naruto attempts to get through to Sora, who keeps attacking him. Sakura attempts to jump in and heal him, but Sora fires a Tailed Beast Ball. While Yamato protects himself, Team Asuma, Kiba, Akamaru and Rock Lee with his Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall, Naruto shields Sakura's body with his own. He tells Sakura to standby until he can save Sora from the Nine-Tailed Fox's spirit, and asks Sakura to heal him first. However, Sora's body is not strong enough to contain the fox's chakra and rejects it. As the chakra is expelled from Sora's body, it takes on the monstrous shape of a fox's head; however, without a host body to take over, the chakra dissipates. Sora is restored to his human self, although he is unconscious. Naruto attempts to wake him up, and Sora manages to hear Naruto and recalls their interactions. As Sora wakes up, Naruto proclaims that Sora could now go home. Sora tells him that he has no home, and Naruto tells him that Konoha is his new home, filled with his new friends. The other Konoha shinobi surround Sora and smile, leaving Sora happy for the first time in his life. Sai also shows up, asking to join, but Naruto rebuffs him, causing everyone to laugh.\nAfter Sora and Naruto are discharged from the hospital, Sora tells Naruto, Sakura and Yamato that he is departing Konoha in order to travel the world and try to make friends. He tells Naruto that he has finally thought of a name for him in the afterlife, which irritates Naruto, who had just learned what the afterlife meant. However, he asks Naruto to convey his well wishes to Asuma. Elsewhere, Asuma and Shikamaru play a game of shōgi where they discuss the king of Konoha. Shikamaru states that it is the Hokage, and Asuma tells him that he once thought the same thing, but that Shikamaru would one day learn otherwise.\nElsewhere, two members of the Akatsuki, Hidan and Kakuzu, track down a woman in Kumogakure. Hidan attempts to strike her with his Triple-Bladed Scythe but misses, and Kakuzu warns his partner not to take the woman lightly, as she is the Two-Tails' jinchūriki.",

  "description": "Asuma visits the grave of his father, Hiruzen Sarutobi, and recalls an old memory in which he fought against his father for not acknowledging him for protecting the king of the Land of Fire. Hiruzen had berated him for still not understanding what or who the king truly was, and at his grave, Asuma tells his father that he finally understands. He leaves his lit cigarette at the grave and walks off. Meanwhile, in Tsunade's office, Shizune alerts the Hokage that Kakashi, who had been sent to find word on the Akatsuki as well as locate Jiraiya, has returned to Konoha and has compiled a report.\nIn the hospital, Sakura cuts some apples for Sai to eat, which the latter interprets as Sakura having a crush on him due to the book he is reading. Naruto, asleep in the next bed, dreams about Sakura feeding him. Sakura then jams an apple in his mouth, nearly causing Naruto to choke, as Kakashi walks in. Naruto prepares to leave the hospital so that they may train but Kakashi warns him that the next stage would be arduous that leaving the hospital without fully recovering would result in dire consequences. Asuma then shows up, asking for a private moment with Kakashi. As he leaves, he appoints Sakura in charge of the two boys.\nOutside, Asuma and Kakashi reminisce how Naruto's generation has grown to the point where they were able to successfully fend off an attack on the village. Kakashi muses that it won't be long before they leave the older shinobi in the dust, and Asuma counters that he still has some good years left in him. Before he can tell Kakashi what was on his mind, they are interrupted by the arrival of Kurenai; Asuma tells Kakashi that they shall discuss the matter later, which piques Kakashi's interest. Kakashi is later summoned to Tsunade's office, where she asks if Naruto is truly capable of learning and mastering a new technique. Kakashi tells her that he is not certain, but he believes that Naruto will most likely succeed.\nElsewhere, Yugito Nii, the Two-Tails jinchūriki, is confronted by Hidan and Kakuzu, two members of the Akatsuki sent to retrieve her. After trapping them in a cave using explosive tags, she enters her tailed-beast form, unleashing the power of Matatabi, the Two-Tailed Cat Spirit. Using the power of her tailed beast, she attempts to hit Hidan with her Cat Flame Roaring Fire. Hidan claims that he is not amused and that the battle would be significantly harder. However, some time later, Hidan is able to use his Retractable Spear along with his Jashin rituals to impale himself and wound Yugito to the point where she is rendered unconscious, allowing the Akatsuki members to complete their mission.",

  "description": "As Hidan finishes his Jashin ritual, Zetsu arrives to take the unconscious Yugito Nii back to the Akatsuki base. Zetsu berates them for taking their time, which Hidan blames on his partner Kakuzu, who is often performing side deals. Kakuzu states that as the one in charge of Akatsuki's finances, money is the most important thing in life, and claims that he only agreed to be Hidan's partner when he was told that religion could be profitable. As Zetsu leaves with Yugito, Hidan and Kakuzu set off towards the Land of Fire to find themselves another jinchūriki.\nBack in Konoha, Naruto is discharged from the hospital and is ready to resume his training. When Yamato and Kakashi ask him to review over what he learned so far, Naruto uses his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to create shadow clones and has them all perform the leaf cutting technique. However, he faints after he dispels all of them and gains their cumulative fatigue.\nKakuzu goes on a detour and brings Hidan to the Fire Temple while searching for the Land of Fire's jinchūriki. Using his Earth Release: Earth Spear, Kakuzu breaks down the Sealed Iron Wall of the temple. Inside, the monks alert Chiriku about the Akatsuki's invasion. Kakuzu recognises Chiriku as a monk who possesses the Gift of the Hermit Group's chakra and has a 30 million bounty on his head. Kakuzu and Hidan go for the attack, but Chiriku uses his Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder, the ultimate technique of the Fire Temple, to block and counter all of their attacks. As Chiriku promises them a funeral, Hidan is outraged at the idea of his funeral rites being presided over by another religion, and receives Kakuzu's blessing to kill Chiriku, although he stipulates that Chiriku be recognisable at the end in order to claim the bounty. The notion of killing humans for money is found despicable by Hidan, but he nonetheless charges at Chiriku with his Triple-Bladed Scythe.\nAs Naruto wakes up, Kakashi explains that the next stage would be to complete his nature transformation by converting his chakra into wind and stopping the flow of a waterfall. Yamato uses his Wood Release to fashion a bridge; using his shadow clones, Naruto stands on the bridge and attempts to slice the flow of the waterfall, recalling Asuma's advice. Unbeknownst to him, both Sai and Sakura are witnessing his training from the woods.\nAt the Fire Temple, Hidan is finishing his Jashin ritual, having killed Chiriku and nearly every other monk, save for Sentoki, who decides to report the massacre to Konoha. Kakuzu takes Chiriku's body before Hidan could finish his ritual and heads to the Land of Fire Bounty Station to claim his 30 million. Hidan takes his Retractable Spear out of his torso, grimacing in pain, as he follows Kakuzu.\nBack at the waterfall, Yamato is in place using his Wood Release: Foo Dog Heads to suppress the Nine-Tails' chakra, should it ever leak. Kakashi is lying on a wooden bench fashioned by Yamato, reading his Icha Icha book. Naruto asks for a shortcut, even asking to create more shadow clones, but Kakashi tells him that there isn't any more space left on the bridge to create shadow clones. Yamato tells Naruto that he has exceeded their expectations, as it would normally take one six months to master leaf cutting while he perfected it in mere hours. Kakashi adds that even Sasuke took a few days to undergo his nature transformation so he could convert his chakra into lightning in order to use Chidori. Naruto states that Sasuke is the very person he needs to catch up to; grabbing wind of Naruto's determination, Kakashi instructs Yamato to create two more waterfalls and extend the bridge, allowing Naruto to create more multiple shadow clones in order to accelerate his training.",

Shikamaru is paired with Asuma, Izumo and Kotetsu, whereas Ino and Chōji left with Raidō and Aoba.

At home, Sakura looks back fondly at the old photo of Team 7 and recalls when she was able to perform the Tree Climbing Practice while Naruto and Sasuke could not, and how the two have surpassed her. At the waterfall, Naruto attempts to sleep, but sees a shooting star and ponders back to the old Team 7 days. Not wanting to take a rest, he gets up and uses his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to continue his training. By daytime, much to Yamato's surprise, Naruto manages to use his chakra to cut the flow of the waterfall in two, successfully passing the second stage.",

Kakashi tells Naruto that the Rasengan is the most perfect example of Shape Transformation, and that if he were to combine his wind chakra with the Rasengan, he would create his own technique. Naruto, however, is stuck on the fact that Kakashi is able to create a Rasengan with one hand while he requires a shadow clone in order to perform it. Kakashi then shows Naruto his Chidori, a perfect example of both shape and nature transformation, as Kakashi combines his chakra with his Lightning Release affinity. Naruto believes Kakashi is showing off, but Kakashi explains that he created the Chidori because he could not add his lightning nature to the Rasengan. He goes on to state that his sensei, the Fourth Hokage, had created the Rasengan with the sole intention of combining it with his own chakra nature but was unable to do so. Naruto realises that the Rasengan is an incomplete technique, and Kakashi tells Naruto that he believes that he is the only shinobi capable of surpassing the Fourth and thus believes that Naruto will succeed in combining both shape and nature transformations.\nAs Asuma's team heads towards the Land of Fire Bounty Station, Shikamaru remarks that Asuma has not lit a cigarette in two days and that the last time he did so was when his father, the Third Hokage, died. Shikamaru asks what the relationship between him and Chiriku was, and Asuma tells him that their relationship was akin to that of Shikamaru and Chōji's. However, he does add that Chiriku is not the reason that he has stopped smoking.\nHidan and Kakuzu arrive at the bounty station, where Kakuzu presents Chiriku to Zangei, the bounty exchange master. Zangei confirms the authenticity of the corpse and presents Kakuzu with 30 million ryo while the complaining Hidan decides to go outside. Kakuzu alerts Zangei that he will not be returning for quite some time as he is headed towards Konoha to locate a jinchūriki. Zangei tells Kakuzu that he does not think that Hidan is a suitable partner for Kakuzu, as he believes his face is unlucky. Kakuzu tells him that while Hidan does not care about money unlike them, he is the perfect partner for him. He further explains that he has killed all of his former partners in the past due to the fact they they provoked him and awakened his killing intent; however, Hidan is unkillable, which makes him the only partner to work with.\nBack in the clearing, Naruto uses his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique in an attempt to form the Rasengan and combine his wind nature with it. He finds himself unable to do so and dispels the clones, but not wanting to give up, tries again. As he attempts to force the wind chakra to combine with the Rasengan, he instantly taps into Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra, which causes his Rasengan to explode and send the shadow clones flying. Naruto transforms into his Version 1 mode, but Yamato is able to use his Wood Release: Foo Dog Heads technique to suppress the chakra, knocking Naruto out. Yamato tells Kakashi that they must stop the training, but Kakashi alerts him that Naruto must continue, and that his success depends on Yamato's ability to suppress the fox whenever it attempts to come out.\nAsuma and his team arrive at the bounty station and wait in the shadows; Hidan, who is sitting outside, remarks how his clothes reek of the smell of rotting corpses and urine. He then notices the presence of someone behind him and turns around.",

  "description": "The other teams reach the other Land of Fire Bounty Stations but are unable to locate the Akatsuki. As Hidan sits outside one of the bounty stations, he turns around to greet what he thought was Kakuzu, but turns out to be none other than Asuma. He recognises the Twelve Guardian Ninja sash Asuma wears; as Asuma attempts to attack him, Hidan attempts to move out of the way, but is frozen in place by Shikamaru's Shadow Sewing Technique. Izumo and Kotetsu then rush at Hidan and impale him in his vital spots, but are surprised to see Hidan is still alive. Hidan confirms that he is immortal, and that they messed up their play by attempting to kill someone who happened to be unkillable. Just then, Kakuzu comes from behind, attempting to strike Shikamaru; Shikamaru dodges, but in doing so is forced to release Hidan.\nKakuzu recognises Asuma as someone who has a bounty on his head and praises Hidan for catching him, but Hidan tells Kakuzu to stay out of the fight, wanting to use the other three for his Jashin rituals. Using his blood to draw a diagram on the ground, he prepares to attack Asuma with his Triple-Bladed Scythe. Asuma offers to attack Hidan while the others back him up, with Shikamaru providing support with his Shadow Sewing Technique. Shikamaru remarks how Asuma is not the one to make a sacrificial play, and remembers the day Asuma taught him how to play shōgi, and how he had beat Asuma using a sacrificial move known as the Climbing Silver. Shikamaru asks Asuma if he is intending to use that same strategy, but Asuma comforts him by telling him that he does not intent to sacrifice his life.\nUsing his chakra blades, Asuma engages in a fight with Hidan, who not only has to dodge Asuma but has to evade being caught by Shikamaru's shadows. Hidan attempts to use his scythe to kill Shikamaru, Izumo and Kotetsu, but the attack is blocked by Asuma's Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder, which is the ultimate technique of the Fire Temple and a specialty of Chiriku's. Although Asuma saved his teammates' lives, Hidan manages to use his scythe to cut Asuma's cheek. Asuma uses his Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning technique to spew a stream of chakra-infused gunpowder to engulf Hidan, but the immortal Akatsuki member calmly walks to the centre of his Jashin diagram and ingests the blood he had nicked from Asuma.",

  "description": "Asuma's Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning seems to incinerate Hidan, but the team is shocked to find out that Asuma had been burned as well. As Asuma rushes towards Hidan with his chakra blades, Hidan uses his Retractable Spear to stab himself in the leg; the same injury appears on Asuma's leg as well, and he collapses. Hidan attempts to stab himself in the heart in order to finish off Asuma, but Shikamaru manages to stop him in the nick of time with his Shadow–Neck Binding Technique. Knowing that he does not have much time to restrain Hidan and cannot completely trust Kakuzu to stay out of the fight, he attempts to analyse Hidan and formulate a defensive strategy.\nTaking in Hidan's remarks about gods, ritual, curses and preparations, as well as recalling that Hidan did not even try to dodge Asuma's attack after licking Asuma's blood off his Triple-Bladed Scythe and instead had walked towards his Jashin diagram, Shikamaru cleverly deduces that Hidan can only link his body with his opponents after ingesting their blood and that his curse only works while he is standing in his circle. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique along with his Shadow-Neck Binding, Shikamaru manages to force Hidan out of his circle; Kakuzu finds Shikamaru both impressive and clever for having figured out the inner workings behind Hidan's curse jutsu.\nAfter forcing Hidan out, Asuma decides to test his theory by throwing a shuriken at Hidan's ear; it manages to tear off a portion of Hidan's but the damage is not reflected on Asuma's ear. Realising Shikamaru's deduction and theories were correct, Asuma limps towards Hidan. Hidan, trapped in place, asks Kakuzu to step in and save him, but Kakuzu merely states that Hidan had done this to himself by being careless. Asuma then uses his Chakra Blade: Straight Line to decapitate Hidan.",

  "description": "Despite being decapitated, Hidan avoids death due to his immortality. He asks his partner Kakuzu for help, who subdues Asuma by landing on his back. Kakuzu uses his Earth Grudge Fear ability to sew Hidan's head back to his body, restoring his partner. Shikamaru is at the end of his limit, having had cancelled his Shadow Sewing Technique shortly after Hidan's decapitation. Izumo uses his Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field while Kotetsu uses his Conch Shell Mace.\nAlthough Kakuzu avoids being hit by the mace, he ends up being stuck by the Starch Syrup. Using his special ability, he unwinds his hands and uses them to keep Izumo and Kotetsu in a death grip. Hidan, now restored, draws his Jashin circle and attempts to finish off Asuma. Asuma, however, attacks back with his chakra blades, but misses; Hidan, however, manages to slice Asuma with his Retractable Spear. Hidan then pulls his Triple-Bladed Scythe and attempts to impale Asuma from behind, but misses when Shikamaru manages to warn Asuma in time. The scythe ends up embedding itself within Hidan, but as Hidan had ingested Asuma's blood and was in his Jashin circle, Asuma is wounded too. Wanting to finish Asuma off, Hidan takes his Retractable Spear and stabs himself in the heart, mortally wounding Asuma.\nBack in Konoha, Kurenai notices a flower drop and split in two, and immediately senses that it is related to Asuma.",

  "description": "Before Hidan and Kakuzu can finish off Shikamaru, Kotetsu and Izumo, they are saved by the arrival of Aoba, Raidō, Chōji and Ino. The latter two take Asuma to the safety of the roof along with Shikamaru while Aoba and Raidō prepare to fight off the Akatsuki. However, the leader of the Akatsuki makes a telepathic call to Hidan and Kakuzu, telling them to retreat as the sealing of the Two-Tails is top priority. The two Akatsuki members leave, although Hidan promises to return soon.\nOn the roof, Ino attempts to use her medical ninjutsu to heal Asuma, but is unable to due to him having four of his vital spots punctured. Knowing he is about to die, he decides to impart his last words to his students. He tells Ino that while she may be bossy, she can be a compassionate caregiver and asks her to look after Shikamaru and Chōji. He also tells her not to lose to Sakura, whether it is in terms of skill or romance. He tells Chōji that he has a caring heart and can be the strongest shinobi if he only puts in more effort, and advises him to lose a few pounds. To Shikamaru, he decides to tell him who the \"king\" of Konoha is and whispers his last words in Shikamaru's ears. As Team 10 reminisce on their past with Asuma, Asuma passes away, and it begins to rain. As Ino and Chōji cry over Asuma's dead body, Shikamaru takes his lighter and claims that he can still feel Asuma's cigarettes stinging his eyes, and proceeds to cry himself.",

  "description": "Naruto struggles to combine his Rasengan with his wind nature. One of his shadow clones enter into its three-tailed form and dispels the other shadow clones, although Yamato is able to suppress and subdue it with his Wood Release: Foo Dog Heads. As Naruto lies down on the ground, the clouds overhead begin to start pouring rain, and Naruto remembers Sasuke. Not wanting to give up now, he resumes his training.\nAt the Akatsuki hideout, Hidan is outraged when he learns that he must stay in place for three days as they extract the Two-Tails from its jinchūriki, Yugito Nii. Hidan tells the leader that he has his own goals and does not care about the Akatsuki's; the leader, however, tells him that so long as he is affiliated with them, he will contribute to their true goal. Claiming that he's the second newest member after Tobi and is unaware of the Akatsuki's plans, the leader divulges how the Akatsuki will create conflict and reap war in order to make a profit and corner the market themselves, using the tailed beasts to create more wars and create their own private army consisting of mercenaries.\nIzumo, Kotetsu and Shikamaru return to Konoha, where they report Asuma's death to Tsunade. Tsunade tells the others to prepare for Asuma's funeral while she breaks the news to Kurenai; Shikamaru, however, offers to do it himself, as he claims he has a message from Asuma to pass on to her.\nIn the clearing, after Naruto explains his trouble of combining the Rasengan and his wind chakra as looking left and right at the same time, Kakashi creates a shadow clone and shows how one can look in two directions at the same time. Recalling how it takes him one shadow clone just to form the Rasengan itself, Naruto decides to have a second shadow clone aid in the process, with the second clone being in charge of creating the wind chakra and applying it to the Rasengan. Naruto's attempts are fruitful, and he ends up creating his own jutsu - Wind Release: Rasengan. Kakashi tells Naruto that he has taken a liking to him, although Naruto misinterprets his words. Before the two can settle their confusion, Yamato reports to the two that Asuma had been killed.",

  "description": "While a funeral service is held for Asuma, Shikamaru decides not to attend, preferring to mourn at home. Putting up a brave front, he spends his days and nights sitting outside his home watching the sky. After his father, Shikaku, invited him to play shōgi and kept discussing Asuma's death, Shikamaru lashes out; Shikaku tells Shikamaru to let out all the feelings he has been bottling inside of him, and leaves as Shikamaru begins to cry uncontrollably.\nAfter he mourns, Shikamaru uses the shōgi pieces to devise a new strategy to defeat Hidan and Kakuzu. Chōji and Ino ask Shikamaru if he really is going to do it, prompting Shikamaru to be somewhat surprised that they were expecting vengeance as well. After formulating a strategy, Shikamaru visits Asuma's grave, apologising to his sensei for not visiting earlier. Team 10 then prepares to leave Konoha in the middle of the night to find them, only to be found by Tsunade. Tsunade does not agree with their idea of revenge, and recalling Nawaki and Dan Katō's deaths, tells them that death is a part of life and that they should grow up. She tells Shikamaru that she will place him on a four-man platoon of her choosing in order to pursue Hidan and Kakuzu, but Shikamaru notifies her that this is something the three of them need to do. He then pulls out Asuma's lighter, telling her that while he has it, he still feels like Asuma is with them. Tsunade retorts that a typical squad would have four people, while they have three; Kakashi, who had been eavesdropping, offers to become Team 10's leader in order for them to be a four-man squad. He privately tells Tsunade that Team 10 would still venture out regardless of her approval, and that this way at least he would be able to keep an eye on them. Tsunade agrees to send Kakashi as their leader, and Shikamaru inquires about Naruto's training. Holding up a bandaged right arm, Kakashi tells him that Naruto would be fine and that he has another team leader anyways. With that, the new Team 10 sets off.",

  "description": "Sakura is notified by Tsunade that Kakashi has temporarily taken over as leader of Team Asuma while they attempt to apprehend the Akatsuki. Sakura offers Team 7 as the most suitable backup for Team 10, but is told that they will only be deployed if Naruto can master his Wind Release: Rasengan technique in the next 24 hours, lest she choose another squad as backup. Heading to the clearing, Sakura conveys Tsunade's message to Naruto and Yamato, and the former decides to begin right away.\nElsewhere, Shikamaru makes amends to his battle plan to accommodate Kakashi, who is impressed by Shikamaru's ability to quickly make revisions. Using her Mind Body Switch Technique, Ino takes over the body of a nearby bird and manages to locate Hidan and Kakuzu about ten minutes away from them. Kakuzu is able to sense that he is being spied and launches an attack towards the bird, prompting Ino to cancel the technique. Ino alerts them of the two Akatsuki member's position and they decide to begin their vengeance.\nUsing his Shadow Imitation Technique, Shikamaru attempts to sneak up from behind them to ensnare them. Hidan and Kakuzu manage to notice it and dodge at the exact time. As they evade the shadow, Shikamaru throws two kunai equipped with explosive tags at them. Hidan and Kakuzu are caught by the blast but manage to survive. As Hidan and Kakuzu move out of the path of the Shadow Imitation, Shikamaru throws Asuma's chakra blades at their shadows, freezing them in place. Hidan is unable to comprehend how they were trapped by their shadows when Shikamaru's shadow did not touch them. Shikamaru explains that he had imbued his chakra within Asuma's chakra blades and added explosive tags to them to throw Hidan and Kakuzu off their true nature. Since the blades carried Shikamaru's chakra, by extension they are given the abilities of Shikamaru's shadow techniques and thus by piercing their shadows, he was able to trap them in place.\nUsing his Shadow Gathering Technique, Shikamaru uses his shadows to remove the chakra blade piercing Hidan's shadow while connecting his own Shadow Imitation to it. Now in control of Hidan, Shikamaru has Hidan pick up his Triple-Bladed Scythe and rush towards Kakuzu, in an attempt to kill him. Kakuzu, who had an arm underground, manages to remove the chakra blade and thus is free to move around, evading Hidan's attack. Shikamaru admits that he was not prepared to Kakuzu to be able to operate his limbs independently but nonetheless tells Chōji, who is observing the fight from a tree along with Ino and Kakashi, to strike Kakuzu from above with his Spiked Human Bullet Tank technique.",

Shikamaru correctly deduces that Kakuzu has five hearts - one in his body and the others in his four masks, one of them which was killed by Kakashi. Realising that the only way to defeat the duo is to split them up, Shikamaru offers to take Hidan away while leaving Chōji and Kakashi to deal with Kakuzu. Using his Shadow Sewing Technique along with his Shadow Shuriken Technique to try and trap Hidan, Shikamaru resorts to rushing at him face to face to link their shadows using his Shadow Imitation Technique after punching him. Now in control of Hidan's body, Shikamaru has him drop his Triple-Bladed Scythe on the ground and runs away into the forest, with Hidan being forced to follow him.\nMeanwhile, Kakuzu merges two of his masks into one in order to combine their Fire Release and their Wind Release. Kakashi realises that each mask possesses a natural chakra affinity that Kakuzu has access to. Kakuzu decides to take their hearts in order to replace the one Kakashi destroyed and attempts to kill Kakashi. In the forest, Shikamaru sets up various traps using kunai and explosive tags, but is unable to maintain the Shadow–Neck Binding Technique on Hidan. Free to move once again, Hidan unveils his Retractable Spear and seemingly cuts Shikamaru's cheek with it. Ingesting the blood, Hidan draws a Jashin circle and stabs himself in the heart.",

  "description": "Kakuzu manages to get the drop on Kakashi, pinning him to the ground. With no way for Kakashi to escape, Kakuzu plans to take his heart to replace the one he lost. As Kakuzu is about to take Kakashi's heart, Hidan impales himself through the heart. Shikamaru falls over, supposedly dead. Hidan mocks Shikamaru for being easily killed and prepares to walk off in order to help Kakuzu. However, Shikamaru gets up and attempts to decapitate Hidan, although his cut is not deep enough. Hidan, clutching his neck, asks how Shikamaru is still alive. In the clearing, Kakuzu is clutching his chest, wondering how Kakashi managed to strike his heart.\nBoth Shikamaru and Kakashi explain to the Akatsuki members in front of them that the entire plan revolved around Hidan using Kakuzu's blood for his Jashin ritual. After Kakashi had struck Kakuzu with his Lightning Blade, he had extracted his blood into a syringe and managed to pass it to Shikamaru. When Hidan attempted to cut Shikamaru's cheek, Shikamaru barely avoided the blow and squeezed Kakuzu's blood onto Hidan's Retractable Spear as well as smearing some on his cheek, in order for Hidan to think it was Shikamaru's blood. Kakuzu then falls over, supposedly dead. However, Team Asuma is still faced with the crisis of dealing with the three elemental masks. Chōji attempts to use his Super Open Hand Slap to pulverise the three, but they survive. The Lightning Release mask goes inside Kakuzu's corpse, giving him its heart and reviving Kakuzu. The revived Kakuzu then has his merged Fire-Wind masks use their Strange Mask Exploding Flame technique to incinerate Kakashi, Chōji and Ino. However, the trio are saved by Team 7, with Naruto combining his new Wind Release: Rasengan with Yamato's Water Release: Tearing Torrent to create a Typhoon Water Vortex Technique that snuffs out Kakuzu's fire-wind attack.",

  "description": "As Team 7 arrives to Team Asuma's rescue, Kakashi asks that a long-range fighter and a medic help Shikamaru defeat Hidan, the other Akatsuki member. Before Sai and Sakura leave, the latter tells Naruto that the outcome of the battle is all up to him. On the way to the woods, Sai asks whether Shikamaru was smart in pursuing Hidan alone, with his motives being personal. Recalling a conversation with Tsunade in which she found out that Shikamaru was invited to be one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, Sakura claims Shikamaru would be alright, calling him the smartest shinobi in the Land of Fire.\nIn the woods, Hidan approaches Shikamaru, preparing to kill him with his Retractable Spear. However, Shikamaru manages to use his Shadow Gathering Technique to pull all the explosive tags he had set around the woods and bind them to Hidan. On top of that, Shikamaru destroys the ground beneath Hidan, destroying his Jashin circle and revealing a huge hole six feet deep. Hidan wonders when Shikamaru had set such a trap and is shocked to find out that it has been created long before Team 10 ambushed them. Hidan reminds Shikamaru that he cannot die, but Shikamaru notifies him that the woods they are in belong to the Nara clan, and that only clan members can enter the area; on top of that, various deer around the area would always be watching him. Lighting Asuma's lighter, he tells Hidan that the moment he cursed Asuma, he had dug his own grave, and that the hole beneath him would serve as his grave. Shikamaru has a vision of Asuma standing next to him, congratulating him and passing down his Will of Fire to him. Smiling, Shikamaru throws the lighter at the explosive tags, causing Hidan to explode.\nMeanwhile in the clearing, Naruto prepares to fight Kakuzu. Kakashi asks in disbelief whether Naruto had already mastered his new Wind Release technique, but Yamato tells him that Naruto can only pull it off half of the time. Kakashi alerts them that Kakuzu had five hearts and that they only managed to destroy two, and that Kakuzu would not be defeated unless the other three are also destroyed. He also adds that Kakuzu is able to use the five elements. Naruto takes his information in stride, and using his Shadow Clone Technique, has his shadow clones fight Kakuzu in close combat. When Kakuzu defeats and dispels the clones, Naruto uses the acquired knowledge from his clones to analyse the Akatsuki in front of him, surprising and impressing Kakashi. Naruto creates more shadow clones, but instead of rushing towards Kakuzu, begins to prepare his Wind Release: Rasengan. Kakashi recalls his training with Naruto, in which he pitted his Rasengan against Naruto's Wind Release: Rasengan, only for Naruto's enhanced version to cancel out Kakashi's and injure the latter's arm. After turning to look back at the improved Naruto, Kakashi sees his former sensei, the Fourth Hokage, within Naruto. Chōji notices the sound Naruto's Rasengan is making and realises that the noise is emitted due to the sheer amount of chakra in the technique; Naruto then proceeds to use his shadow clones to add more wind chakra to the Wind Release: Rasengan, creating a new unique technique - Wind Release: Rasenshuriken.",

  "description": "Naruto forms his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken and has his shadow clones corner Kakuzu. While Kakuzu deals with the clones, the real Naruto manages to sneak up on Kakuzu and tries to hit him with the Rasenshuriken; however, the technique dissipates mere seconds before impact, sparing Kakuzu any injuries. Kakuzu then uses his thick black threads to bind Naruto's body in an attempt to steal his heart. Yamato uses his Wood Release to launch an attack at Kakuzu while Kakashi uses his speed and his Chidori to slice the black threads and rescue Naruto.\nIn the woods, the dismembered Hidan lies in the rubble as he curses Shikamaru, swearing on his god Jashin that he will get his revenge. Shikamaru tells him their beliefs are different, as he chooses to believe in the Will of Fire. Throwing a kunai with an explosive tag attached, Shikamaru tells him that the only god he needs to worry about is him, since he is the one who will be passing judgment. The explosive tag then ignites and causes the dismembered Hidan to be buried. Shikamaru's deer, Rikumaru, unearths Asuma's lighter, which Shikamaru appreciates. He then exits the woods, only to be found by Pakkun, Sakura and Sai, the former having been summoned by Kakashi to aid the two find Shikamaru. Sakura and Sai are surprised to find out that Shikamaru had managed to defeat an immortal Akatsuki member on his own, and the latter credits it due to him having a personal motive. With that, the four set off towards the clearing in order to provide Teams 10 and 7 with backup.\nAt the clearing, Ino remarks how she viewed Naruto differently for a few seconds until his jutsu dissipated, while Chōji remarks that based on the name \"Rasenshuriken\", he thought Naruto would have thrown it. Yamato clears up his confusion, stating that the techniques require a frontal attack. When Naruto decides to have another go, Chōji offers to back him up, with Kakashi stating that it would be for the better as they outnumber him by four; Naruto, however, brings up Kakashi's words about Naruto being the only shinobi who could surpass the Fourth Hokage and asks for another chance to go solo and prove his worth. Kakashi and Yamato grant Naruto the opportunity, and creating more shadow clones, Naruto prepares his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken once more.\nSeeing Naruto getting ready to attack. Kakuzu unleashes the full power of his Earth Grudge Fear ability and rushes towards the Naruto holding the Rasenshuriken, believing the others to be mere shadow clones that will be dispelled once the original dies. He impales Naruto and snuffs out the Rasenshuriken with his black threads, but is surprised when \"Naruto\" is dispelled, proving itself to be none other than a shadow clone. The real Naruto, along with two shadow clones, attack him from above with the Rasenshuriken; Kakuzu is surprised that Naruto hid amongst the shadow clones, and having no way to escape, is forced to take the brunt of the attack. The impact of the Rasenshuriken dispels both shadow clones and sends Naruto flying while propelling Kakuzu a few feet away in mid-air, the attack undoing his threads and bursting all of his hearts. With no more hearts or threads to maintain his body, Kakuzu falls to the ground, defeated. Meanwhile, Chōji, Ino, Yamato and Kakashi marvel at Naruto's success, with the latter being genuinely surprised that he was unable to track the Rasenshuriken's movements with his Sharingan and that Naruto was able to successfully master what he and the Fourth Hokage could not - combining their chakra nature with the Rasengan.",

  "description": "Ino notices that Naruto has yet to stand up after using his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken and rushes over to heal him. Kakashi notes that by successfully mastering what he was unable to do, Naruto had finally surpassed him. He then jumps down into the impact crater created by Naruto and kills the defeated Kakuzu with his Chidori. Team 7 and Team Asuma then return to Konoha to report to Tsunade, with Kakashi having brought back Kakuzu's corpse. Tsunade orders everyone to take a few days off to rest but places Naruto at the Konoha Hospital to have his arm wounds checked out.\nOn their way back home, Shikamaru decides to stop by at Asuma's grave, placing his lighter there. Kurenai is also there, and he tells Kurenai that Asuma was the best role model he ever had, and that he would like to be the same for their child, revealing Kurenai to be pregnant. Shikamaru then returns home, where he plays shōgi with his father Shikaku, with the former claiming that the latter is better at it than Asuma. While playing, Shikamaru asks his father if he knows who the \"king\" of Konoha is, and tells him that Asuma told him that it was the next generation of shinobi, who would bear the burden of the village's safety on their shoulders.\nAfter examining Kakuzu's corpse, Tsunade has Shizune summon Kakashi and Yamato to the coroner's office, where she tells them that Rasenshuriken is more like a poison, working on a microscopic level to cause cellular damage. She explains that Kakuzu's entire Chakra Pathway System had been severed and that Naruto has the same injuries to his right arm, albeit to a lesser degree. Tsunade adds that damage done to the cellular level cannot be treated by her medical ninjutsu and thus labels the technique a kinjutsu, asking Kakashi to make sure that Naruto understands that he is never to use the technique again, while Yamato muses that such a powerful technique does come with the associated risks.\nAt the hospital, Naruto thanks Sakura for taking care of him, although she attempts to convince him not to use the Rasenshuriken anymore unless as a last resort. He fails to understand why, claiming that she could heal his arm every time after, but she reminds him that even her medical ninjutsu can only heal so much. Naruto, however, adds that he prefers the path they are on right now, where the two of them are working together and getting powerful in order to catch up to Sasuke.\nElsewhere, Sasuke prepares his Chidori in front of dummy targets, although by partially activating his Cursed Seal of Heaven, he is able to slice the heads of the dummies without striking them physically with his Chidori. At the same time, Kabuto notifies Orochimaru that Naruto and his team had managed to kill both Hidan and Kakuzu, with Orochimaru being appreciative of the fact that they had spared Naruto's team after all and hoping that Naruto continues to thin the Akatsuki's ranks even further, going as far as mocking the Akatsuki for having lost two members in the same fight. However, he is also aware that they are in possession of the Two-Tails and thus asks Kabuto to fetch a woman named Guren for him, much to Kabuto's dismay.\nKabuto heads out to fetch Guren, a Crystal Release user, who attempts to strike at Kabuto using her Crystal Release: Crystal Needles as well as Crystal: Hexagonal Shuriken: Wild Dance. Kabuto uses his Chakra Scalpel to cut the hexagonal shuriken while berating Guren for attacking him; Guren, nonetheless, states that she believed it was an intruder and that if Kabuto was defeated by her attack, then he would not be worthy to be the right hand man of Orochimaru.",

  "description": "An Anbu member seemingly manages to locate the general area of Orochimaru's hideout and sends a message to Konoha to notify Tsunade, before eliminating all traces of his body. Shizune receives the letter and gives it to Tsunade, who decides to send Kakashi to investigate. She inquires as to Kakashi's whereabouts, and Shizune tells her that he is most likely with Naruto. Jiraiya enters through her window, telling Tsunade that he had popped in to see what Naruto was up to, and Tsunade fills him in on what he had missed.\nAt Ramen Ichiraku, Naruto struggles to eat his miso pork ramen with his dominant right arm in a cast and is nearly fed by Sakura, only for Sai to offer to feed him first, angering Naruto. Kakashi enters the restaurant and attempts to feed Naruto as well, much to the latter's irritation. Kakashi notices Naruto's upset mood and reminds him that he cannot use the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken again and that he considers Naruto his equal, and that Naruto would find a way to use much more powerful techniques. As they exit the shop, Naruto is confronted by Konohamaru, who has perfected the Shadow Clone Technique. With his shadow clones, Konohamaru shows Naruto his new Sexy: Girl on Girl Technique. Sakura is incensed by the move and prepares to punch Konohamaru only for Moegi to strike Konohamaru, causing Sakura to laugh over the deja vu of their actions. She then rounds on Naruto, berating him before the pair is interrupted by Jiraiya.\nAt Orochimaru's hideout, Kabuto brings Guren to the pit where Orochimaru's prisoners are and puts her in charge of monitoring their fight to the death and to ensure that there are some survivors. Inside Orochimaru's chambers, Orochimaru reveals that Guren was to be his candidate for a new body but due to time restraints, he was forced to choose Gen'yūmaru. Orochimaru then reassures a worried Kabuto that Guren is the perfect woman for their upcoming task. Outside, Sasuke is practising his Chidori using the chakra from his Cursed Seal of Heaven. After finishing the technique, he is stunned when he realises he is being watched by a young boy named Yūkimaru. Sasuke tells Yūkimaru to go home, but Yūkimaru tells him that he has no home and asks Sasuke if he has a home, to which the latter claims he does not. Before their conversation can carry any further, Kabuto comes to whisk Yūkimaru away, apologising to Sasuke for the interruption.\nIn her office, Tsunade assigns Kakashi as the leader of a search team she had chosen to locate Orochimaru's hideout. Kakashi reads the file and tells her that he could not think of a better team for this mission. As he heads towards the front gate, the search team is revealed to be none other than Team 8. Shino tells Kakashi that he will use his parasitic insects to locate the enemies' chakra, after which Kiba states that he and Akamaru would be able to locate their scent; Hinata adds that her Byakugan will ensure that they locate the hideout. However, she mentions the fact that they may run into Sasuke at the hideout and inquires as to why Naruto is not coming along. Shino explains that Naruto would not be able to contain himself, a sentiment Kiba echoes, and Kakashi confirms that Naruto is being kept in the dark about this mission.\nAt the top near Hokage Rock, Naruto is saddened over the fact that his Rasenshuriken has a self-inflicting drawback. Jiraiya tells him to be proud of it, as he was able to master what even the Fourth Hokage could not, and subsequently tells Naruto that all he needs is more training, offering Naruto another chance to hit the road with him and train. Naruto agrees, but is dismayed when he finds out that Jiraiya is heading to a hot spring first; however, he cheers up instantly when Jiraiya suggests that he may invite Sakura for a dip as well.",

  "description": "As Team 8, with Kakashi as their temporary leader, head off towards Orochimaru's hideout, Kiba recalls his past experience with Sakon and Ukon, an encounter which left Akamaru seriously injured. Hinata is able to tell that something is on Kiba's mind and Kiba relays his thoughts to them, although he quickly remarks that if Shikamaru and Naruto were able to take out two members of the Akatsuki, then he should be to prove himself against one of Orochimaru's underlings. Shino also voices his desire to prove himself on a mission, and Kiba chalks it up to Shino's irritation of not being a member of the Sasuke Recovery Team. Shino explains that his disappointment is not just because he was not available to participate in the Sasuke Recovery Mission, but also because Naruto did not recognise him when he returned to Konoha. Privately, Hinata remarks on how she too wishes to prove herself so that Naruto may finally acknowledge her, while Kakashi reflects on how far the team has matured.\nBack at the hideout, Guren tells the survivors of the massacre to stop their slaughter and to follow her if they wish to live. At a spa, Jiraiya is shocked to find out that the bath is not a co-ed one and is stuck there with Naruto. Naruto sees the scar on Jiraiya's chest and recalls when he had wounded the sannin in his four-tailed form. Naruto expresses his frustration of how he does not want to use the Nine-Tails' power since it hurts those around him and how he wishes to find another way to gain strength. Jiraiya remarks that Naruto sounds like a veteran shinobi, and reminds him that he must heal his broken arm first.\nThe Orochimaru Search Team manage to track an enemy's scent to Orochimaru's hideout, where they find a man asking for help, riddled with Orochimaru's cursed seal, before he succumbs to his injuries and dies. After activating her Byakugan, Hinata notices chakra signatures of enemies up ahead of them. When they reach them, they are shocked to see various dead or nearly dead prisoners. Before they can get answers, a timed trap is sprung. Though the team manages to evade it, all traces of Orochimaru's hideout, including the bodies, are eliminated.\nIn their hotel room, Jiraiya attempts to goad Naruto by calling him weak, but is surprised when Naruto simply smiles and takes it in stride. Remembering Naruto's desire to save Sasuke three years ago and how Naruto felt the same way he did when he was unable to prevent Orochimaru's desertion, Jiraiya asks whether Naruto still feels the same way. After realising that Naruto is still adamant on rescuing Sasuke, Jiraiya decides that Naruto should learn a new technique.\nAfter escaping the trap, Shino and Kiba manage to pick up the scent of whomever set the trap. Meanwhile, Guren, along with her twenty-one followers, set off towards Orochimaru, only for sixteen of them to revolt and try to kill her. She easily defeats all sixteen of them with her Crystal Release: Crystal Pentagonal Prison technique. The other five then pledge their loyalty to Guren, and now with her newfound team, she sets off. Team 8 manages to track Guren's scent all the way to a meadow, where they are shocked to find people encased in crystal, which then disintegrates, killing the people trapped within. Shino's bugs are encased as well, and Kakashi is stunned to realise that it is none other than Crystal Release.\nIn a clearing, Jiraiya asks Naruto whether he remembers their last training session, which involved toads. Naruto remembers and claims that he does not want to do that again, but Jiraiya claims he is now ready for it. He explains that Naruto would be learning a Cooperation Ninjutsu, citing his Fire Release: Flame Bullet and Gamabunta's Toad Oil Bullet as an example, as both their moves combined creates the more powerful Fire Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet technique. Naruto tells Jiraiya that he had done something similar to Yamato, when the captain had combined his Water Release: Tearing Torrent and Naruto's Wind Release: Rasengan to create the Typhoon Water Vortex Technique. Upon realising that Naruto has aided in a cooperation technique before, he claims that Naruto should be able to do the same with a toad, and proceeds to summon Gamariki, a flamboyant toad who dislikes Naruto. Naruto asks Jiraiya why he can't create a cooperation technique with him, and Jiraiya reminds him that he may not always be there, but that he can always summon toads. Jiraiya then demonstrates to Naruto of using a collaboration technique by sending his chakra into Gamariki to power up his Water Release: Water Gun. Naruto, impressed by this, is told by Jiraiya that his Wind Release should cause him to create an even more powerful version of that technique. However, he is stumped as both Naruto and Gamariki find themselves unable to work or get along with one another.\nMeanwhile, Orochimaru summons Sasuke to his chambers where he announces his desire to test Sasuke's strength, and remarks that he does not detect a flicker of fear from Sasuke. Sasuke confidently tells Orochimaru that he is ready to take him on.",

  "description": "Kabuto takes Yūkimaru to a lake, where he tells the young child that they are about to have fun. After placing some headgear on Yūkimaru's head, Kabuto gives Yūkimaru a pill that causes the latter to release chakra. The chakra begins to draw out a beast hiding underneath the lake, but Yūkimaru passes out due to exertion before the beast is summoned. Kabuto remarks that Yūkimaru is truly useful to Orochimaru and is content with having located the beast.\nIn the woods, Kakashi summons Pakkun. After placing one of the crystals in Pakkun's bandaged paw, he alerts Pakkun that the crystal has one of Shino's bugs encased inside and that it was caused by one of Orochimaru's followers, and asks the hound to bring the crystal to Konoha and relay the situation to Tsunade. Meanwhile, Guren leaves her subordinates at a deserted ruins and tells them to stay put as she heads off towards Orochimaru's hideout.\nNaruto is attempting to perfect his coordination with Gamariki but the friction between the pair causes the two of them to land in the hot spring where Jiraiya was soaking and attempting to peep at the women. The impact of their fall washes out the water, much to the sannin's dismay, as the women exit the springs. Jiraiya berates Gamariki and Naruto, and Naruto states that they are not compatible. He asks to use toads that he is compatible with, but Jiraiya tells him that while his idea is a good one, he is unable to summon with his right arm in a cast. Naruto, grinning, reminds Jiraiya that he has underestimated his healing ability and proceeds to break the cast off and use his summoning technique, calling on both Gamakichi and Gamatatsu, who have now grown much larger.\nOn the way to Orochimaru's hideout, Guren spots her master and Sasuke himself. She recalls when she rushed into his lair to give her body up for Orochimaru to use as his vessel, only for Kabuto to tell her that she was too late and that Orochimaru had chosen Gen'yūmaru, and that Sasuke was to be his next vessel. Angered at what Sasuke has that she does not, she follows the pair to the edge of the woods, where Orochimaru tells Sasuke that he is now going to prove his strength in a battle; however, his opponent is not Orochimaru, but thousands of armed shinobi. Nonetheless, Orochimaru detects no fear in Sasuke's eyes and Sasuke engages against his opponents with his sword in tow.\nOn the cliff top, Naruto is floored at Gamakichi and Gamatatsu's cooperation ninjutsu training, which seems to consist of dance moves and the toads leaping around eating flies. Meanwhile, Sasuke manages to defeat all of his foes without a fatal blow to them. Orochimaru reminds Sasuke that he must be heartless and kill his opponents, but Sasuke retorts that he will be heartless when he kills Itachi. Orochimaru marvels at the sight of Sasuke, as he defeated thousands of opponents without a single drop of blood, and remarks how he was considered a genius in his time but that his prowess does not compare to that of Sasuke's. As Sasuke walks out of the woods, he passes by Guren. The latter is approached by Orochimaru, who asks her whether it is still her dream to be his vessel. When she confirms it, he tells her that he has a special mission for her that only she can complete, and that if she succeeds, he may reconsider choosing her as his next vessel.\nOn their walk back to the hideout, Kabuto notices that Yūkimaru is exhausted and needs rest, and stops at a hot springs, which happens to be the same one Naruto and Jiraiya are at. In the springs, Naruto mentions out loud how the toads' training does not cause him to see what's truly in their hearts and souls. Yūkimaru shocks Naruto with his appearance and asks the genin if what he remarked out loud was true. Naruto reaffirms his comment, and tells Yūkimaru that home is where the person who is always on your mind is. As Yūkimaru praises Naruto for his wisdom, Naruto claims that he knows a lot of things; Yūkimaru then disappears, leaving a stunned Naruto to wonder where he went, noticing a single white flower left behind.\nIn a cave, Kiba is restless as the Orochimaru Search Team is resting. Shino reminds him that they must wait for his insects to locate the enemy and that they might as well rest while they have the chance. In the meantime, Pakkun reaches Konoha with the message from Kakashi, although he asks for some water first before relaying it. In the hot springs, Gamatatsu and Gamakichi use a shrinking technique to enter the water, although Gamatatsu undoes the technique, causing his weight and momentum to drain the water, chasing the women out once more. Jiraiya, hearing their cries, comes out to join the women but is devastated when he finds out that they have left.",

  "description": "Naruto continues his coordination training with Gamatatsu while Gamakichi and Jiraiya observe. After a few hours, he nearly passes out, and is offered a popsicle by Jiraiya. Jiraiya tells him that everyone he has met so far is aware of how strong he is training, and that the mystery is how he keeps it up. Naruto states that he doesn't like to give up and the thought of what Sasuke would think drives him to continue his training; he then passes out on Jiraiya's back. Jiraiya soon gets a message from a bird regarding the Akatsuki and immediately sets off, although not before asking the two toad brothers to continue to help with Naruto's training and to escort him back to Konoha.\nBack in her office, Tsunade observes the crystal and gives it to Shizune to analyse, as per Kakashi's instructions. On their walk back, Yūkimaru notices the view from the valley and spots Naruto walking down below. However, he continues to walk when Kabuto reminds him that Orochimaru is waiting for their return. In the woods, Team 8 comes to a stop when Shino, Kiba and Akamaru are unable to pick up any enemy scents. With her Byakugan, Hinata relays that there are no enemies in their vicinity, picking up only the sight of a bat flying around. Shino senses one of his bugs and informs the group that his bug came into contact with the enemy and survived, and thus has an immunity against Crystal Release. He then plans to find that insect and selectively breed it to create a resistant army, while Kiba, Hinata and Kakashi continue to scout for their target. As they leave, they fail to notice the bat hanging upside down from a tree branch who promptly flies away.\nGuren's team sits in a house, waiting for Guren herself to return. One of them, Rinji, plays a game of dice with the others and notices that Gozu is sitting by himself, unwilling to play. Rinji remarks how Gozu was strong enough to survive the massacre on his own while the others formed alliances and invites him to join their team as a full-fledged member. Rinji then sets out on patrol, where he sees the bat flying above. The bat lands on his arm and uses its ultrasonic mind waves to transmit what it has seen. Knowing that there are enemies out there, Rinji orders the bat to relay a message for him. He is then approached by Gozu, who wishes to go out on patrol with him. In the woods, Kiba hears the ultrasonic frequency and likens it to the sound of a dog whistle, but is confused as neither he nor Akamaru are able to pick up a dog's scent.\nNaruto arrives back in the village, where he is approached by Konohamaru, who decides to show Naruto his new Sexy Technique. Realising that they are in a busy street with people looking at them, Naruto proceeds to hit Konohamaru on the head to prevent the technique. He buys a bowl of ramen for Konohamaru as an apology for hitting him and explains that there is a certain time and place for using the Sexy Technique. Naruto then summons Gamakichi and Gamatatsu to resume his training. Konohamaru is amazed at Naruto's summons and Naruto nonchalantly tells Konohamaru that he usually summons a bigger toad but that these two \"little ones\" will do; Gamakichi reminds Naruto that he is his father's henchman, and Naruto asks him to play it cool as he wishes to impress Konohamaru. However, Gamatatsu refuses to participate in the training unless he is given snacks, and Naruto gives Gama-chan, his purse, to Konohamaru and asks the latter to buy some snacks. After feeding the toad, Naruto asks him to use his Water Release: Water Gun technique, but is floored when he finds out that Gamatatsu cannot use Water Release. Irritated that he has trained with him for nothing, he asks Gamakichi to take his brother's place, only for Gamakichi to tell Naruto that he too cannot use Water Release.",

  "description": "After relaying their mission's results to Orochimaru, Kabuto approaches Guren to tell her that he has orders for her, although not before noticing a bat on the roof on the hideout. He brings Guren into a room with a fountain, where he pairs her with Yūkimaru. Guren is incensed at being forced to travel and take care of a child, but Kabuto reminds her that if she does not succeed in her mission, then she will not have a chance at being Orochimaru's new vessel.\nNaruto and Konohamaru are on a clifftop, with the former outraged at the toads' inability to use Water Release, recalling their father's Water Release: Gunshot technique. However, when the toads decide to ditch him and leave him to train with Gamariki, he decides he would rather train with the brothers and teach them how to use Water Release, which he starts off by having them drink water, much to Konohamaru's dismay.\nIn the deserted ruins, Team Guren awaits for their leader's return while Rinji notifies the other members that there is someone tracking them from the mountains, having picked up on the trail of a dog. He tells them that whomever is following them is most likely doing it to get to Orochimaru and thus they must either be the Akatsuki or shinobi from Konohagakure. Gozu asks why the team does not turn themselves in at Konoha, asking for amnesty in exchange for selling out Orochimaru. Rinji tells him the thought of it had not even crossed his mind, and that he would rather wait for Guren to return as his goal relies on the long run.\nIn the village, Tsunade summons Yamato and asks him to provide assistance to the Orochimaru Search Team, led by Kakashi, and tells him to take Sakura and Sai with him. Yamato inquires whether to bring Naruto as well, but Tsunade voices her strong opinion against it, telling him that Naruto is not to learn of the mission. Meanwhile, Yūkimaru and Guren set off on their walk, with the latter being irritated at their slow pace. Yūkimaru attempts to talk to her about his desire to return somewhere and his love for camellias, but passes out. As Guren is forced to pick him up, her vexation only increases with the arrival of rain.\nShino manages to locate one of the surviving insects and uses his Human Cocoon Technique to shield them from the rain as they proceed to hatch their eggs. The other members of Team 8 are forced to temporarily abandon their search due to the rain washing away the scent and Kiba notices the bats on the cave roof where they have sought refuge. Remember the dog whistle, he alerts Kakashi and Hinata that the enemy is most likely using bats to scout out the vicinity and that they should be on alert.\nIn the meantime, Guren takes Yūkimaru to a hideout where she finds out that he is suffering from a fever, and proceeds to keep his warm with a blanket and a fire as well as holding his hands until his fever breaks. She recalls when she too was bedridden once and promptly awakens, only to discover that it is morning. She immediately notices that Yūkimaru is not in bed and rushes out, hearing the sound of an instrument. Following the sound, she finds the boy, who explains that the instrument belonged to his mother and that his family is no more, thus leaving him without a home. Noticing a camellia falling from the tree above, Guren catches it and crystallises it, presenting it to Yūkimaru and telling him that as long as she is alive, the flower encased within would not wither.",

  "description": "Guren and Yūkimaru arrive at their base, where Guren tells them that Yūkimaru was assigned to them by Orochimaru himself to protect. She alerts her team that they are being followed; however, Rinji tells her that they have already discovered that while waiting for her, and explains that he picked up the trail of four shinobi and a dog. Realising that the Akatsuki does not fit such a description, she remarks that the ones pursuing them are shinobi from Konohagakure. As Team 8 prepares to move out as the rain is subsiding, Shino arrives and tells them that he has found the survivors but that their numbers are small. In order to selectively breed them to drastically increase their numbers, Shino tells the other members of the team to carry on without him. Back in her office, Tsunade is surprised to see a messenger toad summoned in front of her, with a message from Jiraiya.\nBy the lake, Naruto and Konohamaru witness as Gamatatsu attempts to use Water Release. although to no avail. However, after numerous attempts, Naruto resorts to plugging the toad's nose to achieve success. As Guren prepares to head out, she tells Yūkimaru to stay at their base. Seeing the white camellia on the back of her outfit, he is reminded of his mother, who did not return. Scared that Guren will die, he gives up his good luck charm necklace to her, claiming that the crystallised camellia she bestowed to him is his new good luck charm. In the village, Naruto runs into Sai, who is buying new ink. Naruto deduces that Sai buying new ink must mean that he is being sent on a mission. Sai, under orders not to reveal the mission to Naruto, attempts to lie, but his endeavour is noticed by Naruto and only further revealed when Sai drops a book on how to lie; Sai then divulges his mission to Naruto. Enraged, Naruto heads to Tsunade's office and asks to join the Orochimaru Search Team, promising not to use Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. Shizune tells him that they kept him in the dark to protect him and that he is not strong enough to save Sasuke while Tsunade merely asks why he wishes to join the mission. Naruto tells her that he is aware that he is not strong enough to face Sasuke, but that Jiraiya had told him something about home being where people care about you. He tells her that he cares about Sasuke and thus Konoha is his home, and that he believes he can convince Sasuke to return. Tsunade relents, much to Shizune's dismay, and assigns Naruto the team, although she is unable to explain the particulars of the mission as Naruto runs out. When Shizune asks why she gave in to his request, the Hokage merely states that Jiraiya was right and hands her the scroll she received from him; in the letter, he tells her that while Naruto is young and still an idiot, he has the power to change people and will one day change himself, and that when Naruto asks her for a chance to prove himself, he hopes she trusts him.\nGuren spots a red camellia and is reminded of Yūkimaru. Meanwhile, Kiba notices the scent of a bat and under Kakashi's instructions, the team takes a detour. Kakashi explains that bats have a limited range and with the forest around them providing obstruction, they can easily keep away from the bats; however, they cannot stray too far from the enemies' vicinity nor allow the bats not to track them every now and then, as it would alert their enemies. In the village, now being an official member of the mission, Naruto heads down to the lake and asks Gamakichi to help him perfect a cooperation ninjutsu in order to use it on his mission. Gamakichi tells Naruto to get inside Gamatatsu's mouth so that the two of them can be in harmony with one another. In the meantime, Team Yamato arrive at the front gates, where Sai is dismayed that he gave in to Naruto. Sakura comforts him by telling him that Naruto would have found out eventually and the fact that he is tagging along makes for great teamwork, although she wonders why he is late. Yamato also tells him that Tsunade isn't one to cave into Naruto's pressure and that she must trust him if she relented and assigned him to the mission. Back in the forest, Kakashi asks Hinata to use Byakugan, and she picks up the chakra of four shinobi.",

  "description": "Naruto continues his training with Gamakichi and Gamatatsu but his session is cut short by the arrival of Sakura, who arrives to drag him away as Team Yamato was waiting for him so they could depart. In the forest, Hinata uses her Byakugan to locate four chakra signatures in front of her, and quickly notices one from behind them. She warns the others as Gozu attacks from behind, using a partial multi-size technique to slam a giant fist towards Kakashi, who manages to block it. As Kakashi and Gozu whisk throughout the trees continuing their battle, Hinata, Kiba and Akamaru are left to face the likes of Rinji, Kihō, Nurari and Kigiri. Not wanting to deal with Kigiri due to the mask on his face, Kiba has Akamaru transform into him as he attempts to hit Nurari with his Fang Passing Fang. Nurari is able to evade the technique as Kigiri uses his Destroying Smell Smoke Prison to create a thick smokescreen to rob Kiba and Akamaru of their sense of sight and smell.\nNurari attempts to finish the blinded Kiba off, but he is saved by Hinata, who tells Kiba to deal with the others as she deals with Nurari. Nurari is shocked when he realises that Hinata can see him, but is reassured when Hinata's Gentle Fist attacks are unable to harm him. In the meantime, Kakashi continues to fight against Gozu. Using a shadow clone to trick Gozu, Kakashi believes he has the upper hand, but Gozu is able to move at enhanced speed to elude the real Kakashi and proceeds to sneak up behind him and kick him with enough force to destroy a free. Pushed to his limit, Kakashi is forced to use his Sharingan and manages to evade one of Gozu's attacks. He prepares a Lightning Cutter but finds himself unable to pinpoint an opening.\nUsing his Slime Suit, Nurari is able to avoid being stuck directly by Hinata's Gentle Fist and he proceeds to attack her. Before she can be finished off, she is saved by Kiba and Akamaru, who uses their Fang Passing Fang through the air and trees to create a windstorm to dispel the smokescreen. With his sense of smell and sight restored, Kiba proudly exclaims that he would be able to handle Nurari before being struck by poison gas emitted from Kihō's Wrist Launcher. Kiba berates himself for being stupid enough to forget that there are other enemies, but before Team Guren can finish the three off, Rinji senses something surrounding them. Deeming it dangerous, he orders the group to retreat. Kiba's confusion over the matter is absolved when he is greeted by Shino, who explains that he was casting a trap around them before Rinji's acute senses picked up on it. Kakashi also stumbles in on them; Kiba asks whether he dealt with Gozu and Kakashi states that he was unable to, although he managed to use his Lightning Cutter to give Gozu a serious arm wound.\nKakashi tells them that their fight is far from over and that their enemies are still out there; unbeknownst to him, the entire battle was being watched by Guren via a crystal ball, who is surprised that Kakashi the Copy Ninja was sent to pursue her. Meanwhile, Yūkimaru reminisces on memories of his mother.",

  "description": "In Konoha, the crystallised bug is analysed and Tsunade confirms her suspicion to Shizune about Orochimaru's follower using Crystal Release, an ability thought to be non-existent. Team Yamato finds themselves lost as Kakashi had not left any trails or signs for them to follow; Sai creates an ink bird to fly above the perimeter to scout for any signs while Naruto excuses himself from the group on the pretence of relieving himself. However, once he finds himself secluded, he attempts to continue his training in secret until he notices a light mist settling in and spots Yūkimaru, the young boy he had met at the hot springs. Yūkimaru is cryptic, but after Naruto reaffirms that the people who are thinking about you is where your home is, Yūkimaru disappears, along with the mist. Sakura arrives, and believing that Naruto is lying about having encountered someone, ushers him off as Yamato had found one of Shino's bugs.\nIn the meantime, Guren berates her team for failing to dispose of their pursuers and launches her own plan. She proceeds to create a jade crystal dome that traps Team 8. Guren then produces a crystal mirror in order to create six jade crystal clones. Team 8, meanwhile, finds themselves lost in the woods as Shino's bugs are unable to locate the enemy, having lost their movement; to make matter worse, Hinata finds herself unable to effectively use her Byakugan to find their foes, as she can only see the images of her team refracted over and over again. Guren and her clones arrive to deal with Team 8, generating jade crystal blades from her forearms. Kakashi uncovers his Sharingan to give him an edge, but Guren reveals that her Crystal Release cannot be copied. Elsewhere, Hinata manages to defeat one of the clones with her Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms, though she is encased within a jade crystal prison by another crystal clone. The other crystal clones stop their fight with their respective opponents in order to lure them into a clearing, where Guren warns them that should they interfere any further, the confined Hinata would disintegrate into shards.\nOn the outside, Team Yamato finds themselves unable to break through the crystal labyrinth. Using his ink bird, Sai notifies them that the dome is a kilometre in length with the top covered, and does not have any weak spots. Using his Wood Release: Great Forest Technique, Yamato attempts to penetrate through the labyrinth, only for the crystal to not respond; he attempts to create a tunnel, but finds out that the crystal is embedded underground as well. Confident that his new technique would do the trick, Naruto summons Gamakichi and Gamatatsu, surprising Sakura and Sai, with the latter asking when he had learned such an impressive technique. Infusing his wind chakra with Gamatatsu's Water Release: Water Gun, the duo manage to create Wind Release: Toad Gun, which manages to puncture the crystal.",

  "description": "Naruto and Gamatatsu's cooperation ninjutsu manage to destroy Guren's jade crystal labyrinth. Team Yamato then arrives to provide reinforcements, and Naruto notices that Hinata has been encased in Guren's jade crystal. Kakashi warns Naruto not to be abrupt as Hinata would die if the crystal were to shatter; nonetheless, Naruto and Gamatatsu use their Wind Release: Toad Gun towards Guren, who crystallises it and fashions it into a crystal dragon. As she uses the crystal dragon to attack the Orochimaru Search Team, Sai uses his ink bird to distract Guren while Naruto has Gamatatsu swallow the crystal-confined Hinata in order to take away Guren's leverage. Guren destroys Sai's ink bird and attempts to direct her attack towards Gamatatsu, who dispels himself to avoid the hit. The rest of the team also retreats, leaving Guren alone. Team Guren then arrives to provide Guren some personal reinforcement, and they set off back towards their base.\nOutside the perimeter, Naruto has Gamatatsu slowly regurgitate Hinata, who nearly kills her when he is distracted by a fly. Pakkun arrives and notifies the team that the analysis on Shino's bug revealed that even the bug's insides were crystallised. Realising the same fate has struck Hinata, Kakashi orders the group to escort Hinata back to Konoha, in hopes that Tsunade would be able to undo the damage. However, Hinata's crystal shatters, although Hinata survives. Hinata explains to the group that she began to emit chakra from all of her chakra points before she was crystallised, notifying Kakashi that Guren's Crystal Release is unable to crystallise chakra. Kakashi then tells them that since their team has enough members, they would now be splitting into two. He tasks Sai and Sakura with the responsibility of staying with Hinata until she recovers while the others try to pick up on their enemies trail once more. As the team sets off, with Pakkun, Gamatatsu and Gamakichi dispelling themselves, they are unaware that they have been spied on by Kabuto the entire time.\nAs Guren and her team return to their base, Yūkimaru is excited to see Guren return, and reveals to her that he had met a boy with a headband while she was gone. Realising that Yūkimaru had met Naruto by coincidence, Guren asks him to tell her where they had met so that she could track him; however, her endeavour is interrupted by the arrival of Kabuto, who admonishes her for nearly losing Yūkimaru to Naruto, which would have foiled Orochimaru's plan. In the meantime, the rest of the search team continues to travel through the woods, with Naruto expressing his annoyance of avoiding bats. Shino proposes that they use the bats to find their enemies, as the bats are awaiting their detection before returning to their master. Although Naruto does not understand the plan, Kakashi asks him to create three shadow clones and have them run throughout the woods. Naruto complies, although he wonders why he did so as the bats have detected his clones. Kiba explains that once the bats detect his shadow clones, they would fly back to their master, and that the team would simply follow the bats to find their enemies' hideout. Kiba then proceeds to humiliate Naruto for his lower intelligence and berating him for being a genin while the other members are chūnin and jōnin, causing Naruto to emit a large cloud of flatulence in response towards Kiba and Akamaru.\nConcurrently, Kabuto and Team Guren head towards the lake, where Kabuto, Yūkimaru, Guren and Gozu enter a canoe. Kabuto tasks the remaining members to remain on land and engage their pursuers while Gozu rows them out to the middle of the lake. Guren creates jade crystal hexagonal pillars while Kabuto proceeds to give Yūkimaru food pills in order to cause the latter to release his chakra; Guren protests that the pills could cause Yūkimaru's death, but is shot down when Kabuto remarks that he is merely following Orochimaru's plan. Gozu wonders what the plan is, and Guren and Kabuto reveal to him that they are summoning the Three-Tails.",

  "description": "Following Sasori's demise, Tobi is partnered with Deidara as the duo begin their hunt for the Three-Tailed Turtle. By the lake, Yūkimaru releases his chakra and summons the Three-Tails while Kabuto exclaims that their plan has succeeded.\nIn the woods, Rinji's bats report to him that there are more shinobi pursuing them. In order to thin the herd, he asks Kihō to use his Wrist Launcher to deploy a smokescreen. Before the group can dive into the smokescreen, Shino, Kiba and Akamaru detect a strong chakra coming from the lake. Kakashi notifies them that their goal is to head to the lake and thus sends Naruto on his own, relying on Naruto's adept survival capabilities and his unpredictable manoeuvers, while the others deal with Team Guren inside the smoke.\nYūkimaru passes out from overexertion while Kabuto orders Guren to restrain the Three-Tails. With Gozu providing reinforcement, Guren uses her Crystal Release: The Gods' Crossings Technique to repress the tailed beast, although to no avail. Eventually, Guren manages to trap the beast with her Crystal Release: Jade Crystal Wall Eighth Formation. Meanwhile, Naruto traipses through the fog and ends up falling off a cliff and plummeting into the water, leaving him to summon Gamatatsu and Gamakichi in order to save him. Riding on Gamatatsu, the trio wade through the water until they reach the encased beast, and Gamakichi fearfully notifies Naruto that it is none other than the Three-Tailed Turtle. Naruto also spots Yūkimaru and realises that Yūkimaru's \"home\" was Guren and Kabuto. As the Three-Tails makes contact with Naruto, it breaks out of its confines and begins its rampage.\nBack on land, Guren's team prepares to ambush the search team from above when Hinata, using her Byakugan to spot them, warns them of the attack. She, along with Sakura and Sai, counter the ambush and force Team Guren to retreat. Kakashi senses something amiss as the Three-Tails begins its rampage and the smokescreen clears away, only to reveal a large body of water headed their way. In the lake, Guren attempts to strike the tailed beast but fails, and in an attempt to protect her, Yūkimaru unleashes his chakra once more in order to control and subdue the turtle. As both he and Guren fall into the water, Guren saves both of them. Yūkimaru then takes Guren's body to shore and promises her that this time it would be he who holds her hands.",

  "description": "As the Three-Tails retreats, the wave from his rampage sends Naruto towards the land. Separated from the others, he finds himself covered by a mist that induces genjutsu. Within the illusion, he sees Orochimaru asking Naruto to stop interfering with his plans and proceeds to begin his Living Corpse Reincarnation technique in order to take over Sasuke's body. Naruto forms a Rasengan in one hand and attempts to strike \"Orochimaru\" in the face, only to be stopped by Kakashi, as Naruto was about to strike Kiba. As the others regroup around him, Naruto reveals that the Three-Tails was the one rampaging on the lake. As this complicates matters for them, Kakashi has Pakkun go to Konoha in order to receive orders from Tsunade; in the meantime, they will simply wait. Naruto is impatient as he wishes to save Yūkimaru, but Kakashi does not allow him to go exploring on his own due to the fact that the illusionary mist, emitted by the Three-Tails, had nearly caused him to kill his own teammate.\nGozu swims to shore and meets up with the other members of Team Guren, but promptly leaves in order to find Guren. Elsewhere, Yūkimaru watches over Guren as she wakes up, and the latter is surprised to find out that he had done so. She expresses shock when he tells her that his home is with her, but quickly falls under the effects of a fever, caused by Kabuto's pills. She finds herself playing nurse for him once more, and thus, unable to regroup with the others.\nPakkun arrives in Konoha and relays Kakashi's information regarding the Three-Tails to Tsunade. Realising that the Akatsuki may soon arrive if word gets out, she decides that they must acquire the beast first and thus appoints Shizune, Ino, Rock Lee and Tenten to the Orochimaru Search Team. Ino and Shizune, along with Hinata and Sakura, are tasked with using their medical ninjutsu to deal with the fūinjutsu whilst Lee and Tenten are to take over Hinata and Sakura's combat duties.\nMeanwhile, Naruto and Sakura are given patrol duty but the former shirks off by a cliff in order to contemplate on Yūkimaru's association with Orochimaru's followers. He tells Sakura that Jiraiya had told him that home is where the people who care about you are, and that as long as people are thinking about you, they would always have a home. Believing that he is talking about Sasuke, Sakura comforts him by saying that they will never forget or give up on him and thus Konoha shall always be his home. As she walks off to resume patrol duty, Naruto reaffirms that so long as he always thinks of Yūkimaru, then the latter's home would be Konoha, and thus sets off to find the boy.",

  "description": "As Naruto runs off to find Yūkimaru, Guren manages to spot him with her crystal ball and heads off to intercept him. Kiba, Akamaru and Sai arrive to relieve Sakura and Naruto of their patrol duty, only to find out that Naruto had gone AWOL. As Pakkun is busy leading Ino, Shizune, Rock Lee and Tenten to their location, Kakashi summons Bisuke, another ninken, and asks him to locate Naruto. He then tasks Kiba, Hinata and Shino with surveillance of their perimeter while Sai and Sakura are to provide aerial reconnaissance, telling them not to go off on their own and to work together.\nNaruto is ambushed by Guren, and the former asks her about Yūkimaru. Believing that Naruto is after Yūkimaru due to his power to control the Three-Tails, Guren attempts to kill him. However, their bout is brought to a temporary standstill by the arrival of Yūkimaru, who thanks Naruto for his words of advice. Naruto blames himself for telling Yūkimaru that and thus attempts to rectify his mistake by asking him to come to Konoha. Yūkimaru tells Naruto that Guren is nice to him and always protects him and thus she is his home; Naruto retorts that as she is one of Orochimaru's lackeys, he considers her to be just as bad as he is and that she must view Yūkimaru as merely a tool to meet her ends. Guren then attempts to flee with Yūkimaru as Naruto creates shadow clones to stop her. Guren is able to dispel the clones, and is saved by both Gozu and Yamato, the former saving Guren and Yūkimaru while the latter restrains Naruto with his Wood Release. The two jōnin admonish Naruto for leaving his team and disobeying orders while Yamato reminds him that Tsunade had trusted him to cooperate on the mission, a trust that was not given lightly.\nBack at their hideout, Kabuto notifies Guren that there are more members to the Orochimaru Search Team and tells Guren that he plans to use Yūkimaru once more to restrain and control the Three-Tails, stating that Yūkimaru is merely a tool to help serve Orochimaru and that it is Yūkimaru's only reason for existing. As Guren threatens Kabuto and walks away, muttering about Yūkimaru's health, Rinji chides her by asking whether she cares for the boy, only for Guren to claim that Yūkimaru is truly nothing but a tool to her.\nAs Naruto, Kakashi and Yamato head back to camp, Kakashi wonders why Team Guren would be bringing a young child with them. He surmises that Yūkimaru must possess a power to control the tailed beast, an assumption proved correct by Naruto, and he formulates a strategy to foil Orochimaru's plan by snatching the boy away from them. As they make their way back, Sakura jumps from Sai's ink bird and ambushes Naruto, pummelling him into the ground to teach him a lesson. As she finishes up, she tells them that Pakkun has returned with reinforcements, whom Naruto is excited to see once more.",

  "description": "Naruto is overjoyed to see Lee once more, while Sakura and Ino resume their rivalry. Back at their hideout, Kabuto asks Yūkimaru if he would like to return to Orochimaru with him, but Yūkimaru refuses to come unless Guren accompanies him. Yūkimaru attempts to flee when Kabuto reminds him that he belongs to Orochimaru, prompting Kabuto to yank Yūkimaru around and slap him. Immediately after, Guren slashes at Kabuto with her crystals and warns Kabuto not to lay a finger on Yūkimaru again. As Kabuto leaves, Yūkimaru reminds Guren that he would like to be wherever she is, prompting her to run away into the mist.\nOutside, Gozu begins to question Rinji's loyalty towards Guren. Rinji reassures him that he would not betray Guren as he needs the money to help his ill-struck sister. However, Rinji turns out to be a spy working for Orochimaru, who was placed within the prison by Kabuto to spy on the other inmates and subsequently assigned to Team Guren to spy on Guren herself. Rinji tells Kabuto that he believes Guren is being distracted by Yūkimaru's well being and asks Kabuto if he may report to Orochimaru himself, wanting to prove his diligence. Kabuto relents, and Rinji joins up with Guren, albeit running into Gozu first. He sneaks up on Guren, who is contemplating Naruto's words about Orochimaru using people as tools and discarding them and finding herself worrying about Yūkimaru's fate. As she attempts to brush off her thoughts and focus on her mission, she is startled by Rinji's presence; the two prepare to formulate a strategy as the mist lifts, unaware that they are being watched by Yūkimaru.\nConcurrently, the Konoha shinobi take refuge in their own hideout, a wooden house built by Yamato. After being debriefed by Yamato and Kakashi, Shizune notifies them that Tsunade's plan is for them to use fūinjutsu to seal the Three-Tails into another dimension. She places Hinata, Ino and Sakura under her command, forming a sub-team, that will focus on sealing the tailed beast and protecting Yūkimaru while the others deal with Guren and her team. Knowing that Shizune's team cannot protect the boy and seal the beast at the same time, Kakashi splits the other team into two as well, assigning Kiba, Akamaru, Lee and Tenten on Yamato's team as their guardians while he takes command of Naruto, Shino and Sai, who are to deal with Guren.",

  "description": "The Orochimaru Search Team split off into their three respective sub-teams; Shizune's team begin to erect their Four-Corner Sealing Barrier while Yamato and Kakashi's team head off to defeat Team Guren. Lee is dismayed as he is not on Kakashi's team, as he wanted to fight a Crystal Release user, but Kiba comforts him by telling him that her followers are pretty powerful on their own. With Tenten asking to join their conversation, he debriefs them on their attacks, including their reliance on a smokescreen.\nAs Kakashi's team heads towards the woods, Naruto picks up at the silence and stares between Shino and Sai. Realising that the two have never met before, he introduces one another; he tells Shino that Sai that once a member of the Anbu who is weird and reads books all the time, but who can also draw and fight really well. He then tells Sai that Shino is merely Shino. Sai reveals to Naruto that Shino is the son of Shibi Aburame, the head of the Aburame Clan, and that Shino himself has completed various missions successfully and possesses the ability to control parasitic insects. Naruto is surprised to know that Sai knows that much about Shino, but Shino is insulted that a complete stranger knows more about him than an old friend and comrade. Shino starts to tell Naruto about his favourite foods, likes and dislikes, but is shot down by Naruto, who tells Shino that he does need to know such stuff in order to perform teamwork.\nElsewhere, Guren is conflicted over her loyalty to Orochimaru and her caring for Yūkimaru. With Gozu by her side, she resolves to deal with the Konoha shinobi before dealing with Kabuto, whom she is vexed at. The sealing team begin their barrier but it collapses shortly after as Ino is unable to maintain her chakra control. After a few encouraging words from Sakura and recalling when Sakura had done the same thing years ago, Ino gets up and resolves to stick it through. Meanwhile, Kigiri appears out of the water, and Kiba identifies him as the smokescreen user. In order to prevent his tactic, Yamato restrains him with his Wood Release while Lee rushes to deliver a Leaf Whirlwind; however, the restrained Kigiri is revealed to be none other than a Smoke Clone. As the other members of Team Guren emerge from the water, the real Kigiri disperses a smokescreen that engulfs Lee. As Kihō awaits Rinji's orders, the latter merely states that he has other matters to attend to and disappears. Despite his sense of sight being robbed, Lee is able to sense Kihō's presence and manages to strike a few blows on him, before kicking him up into the air and using the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf to seismic toss him back into the water. With Lee safely out of the smokescreen, leaving only their enemies trapped within, Tenten unfurls her scrolls and strikes them with her Twin Rising Dragons, causing her to defeat them and nearly knock them out. Kiba, appalled and insulted that he had trouble taking on one when Lee and Tenten managed to easily take them down, rushes at them in order to regain his pride. Using Akamaru's Dynamic Marking to mark them with urine, he tracks them down through Kigiri's smokescreen and hits all three of them with his Fang Passing Fang, sending them flying away. With the cohorts having been dealt with, Yamato's team heads off to provide support and backup for Kakashi's.\nIn the meantime, Shino prepares himself while Kakashi reminds Sai that his job is to protect his comrades at all costs, something he may not be familiar with as he was a member of the Anbu, who value mission completion over the lives of teammates. Sai reveals that the reason he is still on Team Kakashi is because he wishes to do exactly that, having learned the value of friendship. However, they are then ambushed by Gozu, who attempts to strike them. Naruto spots Guren and exclaims that he is willing to do what it takes to take Yūkimaru away from her since she views him as nothing but a mere tool; wounded by Naruto's words, she strikes back in anger, only for her jab to be countered by Kakashi. Sai attempts to retaliate with an ink beast, but Gozu is able to restrain and destroy it. Shino, who is observing the battle as he prepares his chakra, suddenly stands up and releases his insects.",

  "description": "Tobi and Deidara part ways after the latter becomes infuriated towards the former. Concurrently, Kakashi and Naruto fight with Guren while Sai deals with Gozu. Incensed at Naruto's words regarding her treatment of Yūkimaru, Guren decides not to hold back and push herself to her limits, knocking Naruto out of the way and going up against Kakashi and his Lightning Cutter, although she manages to wound Kakashi with her crystal thorns.\nLee and Tenten berate Kiba for exaggerating Team Guren's prowess, with Lee hoping that the Crystal Release user would be much more powerful. However, Yamato tells him that he would not be fighting Guren, as he is assigning him and Tenten to protect the sealing team while he, Kiba and Akamaru provide backup for Kakashi's team. Sai manages to use his Ink Flush to create a nest of snakes to bind Gozu, keeping him out of the battle. Guren attempts to finish off the wounded Kakashi but the latter is saved by the arrival of Shino, whose bugs have developed a resilience towards Guren's crystal. Guren proceeds to encase all of the bugs individually, but is shocked when the bugs manage to free themselves. In the meantime, Naruto creates shadow clones and has each of them prepare a Rasengan; he then rushes towards Guren with his Ultra-Many Spiralling Serial Spheres technique. In order to protect herself, Guren uses her Crystal Release: Crystal Encampment Wall technique, which sends out a wave of chakra which turns into a nigh-impenetrable crystal wall capable of self-regeneration.\nTobi happens upon the lake and witness Shizune's team attempting to use the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier in order to seal away the Three-Tails. He proudly exclaims that he has found the Three-Tails before remembering that Deidara is not with him, and spots Rinji, who is spying on the sealing team from afar. Wanting to interfere with their plans, Rinji runs towards them as they are incapable of defending themselves, only to be repelled by the arrival of Lee and Tenten, with the former striking him with Leaf Whirlwind. Not wanting to fight two foes at once, Rinji disappears. Kabuto, who is witnessing the event, decides that he cannot allow the shinobi of Konoha to seal away the Three-Tails and decides to use Yūkimaru once more to control the tailed beast.\nGozu notices Guren's technique and realises that she is in trouble. Using his mud body, he escapes from Sai's binds and leaves Sai covered in mud. Kakashi instructs Shino to direct all of his bugs in one spot in order to create a weak spot, and attempts to strike at the spot with his Lightning Cutter, only for the attack to be blocked by Gozu. Using his mud, he pushes Guren to safety and destroys Shino's bugs while Kakashi seemingly kills him with his Lightning Cutter.\nAs Guren comes to, she wonders why Gozu would have risked his life to save her until she is wrought with a flashback of murdering Yūkimaru's mother. Wondering if it is true or not, she arrives at her hideout and is about to approach Yūkimaru when she is found by Kabuto, who tells her that she is to help him use Yūkimaru to control the Three-Tails; if she does not comply, he would break the boy's heart by revealing the truth about his mother's demise. With her doubt being confirmed, Guren reluctantly agrees, and the three take off towards the lake; Kabuto recalls Orochimaru's words to him regarding Guren - Orochimaru had told him in advance that Guren would bond with Yūkimaru due to her involvement in his mother's death, and that there would come a time when she would betray them, at which point Kabuto was to step in and prevent it. Kabuto smiles to himself as he remarks that the time has finally come.",

  "description": "Guren and Kabuto return to the lake where the latter attempts to feed Yūkimaru many pills. Knowing that the pills would come at the cost of Yūkimaru's life, Guren offers to deal with the tailed beast without Yūkimaru's involvement. Kabuto relents, but only if she follows his orders, and sends Rinji to relay his orders when the time comes. As she waits by the clifftop for Rinji, Kabuto brings Yūkimaru to an adjacent clifftop, with a view of the Konoha shinobi attempting their Four-Corner Sealing Barrier. He reminds Yūkimaru that Guren is willing to tackle a tailed beast all on her own just to save him, and that she may die from the effort.\nRinji approaches Guren and notifies her that the two people guarding the fūinjutsu team is a weapons-user and a taijutsu expert. Knowing her chakra is limited, Guren offers herself as bait to draw the attention of the two guardians while Rinji is to take out the sealing barrier. Lee and Tenten are surprised to see the Crystal Release user in front of them, as they had believed that Kakashi's team had dealt with her. Using her jade crystal blades on her forearms along with her Crystal Armour, she proves to be a formidable opponent for the two. She manages to distract the two while Rinji heads towards the sealing team, who are defenseless, only to be repelled by Naruto and Gamatatsu's Wind Release: Toad Gun. Lee is overjoyed to see Naruto, who had summoned Gamatatsu and Gamakichi. Shino is present as well, who attempts to use his bugs against Guren's crystal, only for it to fail against Guren's Crystal Release: Tearing Crystal Falling Dragon.\nHowever, the tide of their bout turns when the Three-Tails manages to break out of its barrier. Guren tells Rinji to retreat, as their job of breaking the barrier has been successful. As they attempt to flee, the Three-Tailed Turtle uses his Water Release: Great Water Mass Bullet to destroy Guren's crystal dragon and sent her to shore on an island; Naruto and Shino are sent underwater while Gamakichi and Gamatatsu dispel themselves; Lee manages to save Ino as he reaches land. Yamato and Kiba meet up with Kakashi and Sai, with the latter team revealing that they had failed to defeat Guren. However, all four of them hear the cries of the tailed beast and realise that trouble is in the air. Meanwhile, Yūkimaru spots the Three-Tails about to harm a winded-out Guren and taps into his Three-Tails Chakra: Release to control the beast and prevent Guren's death. As Rinji spots Yūkimaru, it turns out that this was Orochimaru's plan all along - he knew that Yūkimaru would not unleash his true power while being forced to do so, and would only do it to protect a loved one, hence why he tasked Guren to his protection, knowing a bond would form between them. In the meantime, Tobi of the Akatsuki moves fleetingly around the perimeter as he observes the Three-Tails, gleeful that he has truly located it after all.",

  "description": "Yūkimaru manages to hold off the Three-Tails long enough for Guren to stand up, who moves out of the way just as the Three-Tails regains its self-control. Rinji stealthily stabs Guren with his kunai and moves Yūkimaru and himself out of the way as the Three-Tails' Water Release: Great Water Mass Bullet strikes the cliff. Seeing the wounded Guren, Yūkimaru is told that she will die unless he takes control of the Three-Tails. Yūkimaru complies, but is unable to continue after running out of chakra. Rinji flees as Yūkimaru decides to protect Guren with his life. As the Three-Tails launches another attack, Guren moves him out of the way and keeps him safely encased with her Crystal Release: Crimson Fruit while she deals with the tailed beast.\nTeam Guren nurse themselves from their injuries, unaware that they are being watched by Tobi. Tobi then decides that he needes Deidara's assistance and runs off to retrieve him. Lee, Shizune, Sakura, Tenten and Ino are all safely on shore as Kakashi, Yamato, Kiba and Akamaru catch up with Naruto and Shino. Naruto rushes off to save Yūkimaru while the others follow behind him. Naruto manages to reach Yūkimaru first, seeing him trapped in Guren's crystal, but finds himself face-to-face with the Three-Tailed Turtle. He attempts to strike it with his Rasengan but fails, and Guren attempts the same with her Crystal Release: Tearing Crystal Falling Dragon. As a wounded Guren begins to drown, she converts her life force into chakra, allowing her to use powerful techniques such as Crystal Release: String of Glory to withstand the brunt of the Three-Tails' Water Mass Bullet technique and fire a prism at the beast's eyes; Naruto follows up with a Big Ball Rasengan at its eyes as well, having determined it to be its weak spot. Enraged, the beast whips up a tidal wave that engulfs the duo.\nKakashi and his team arrive as Yūkimaru's crystal shield breaks. As they take him away, they are unaware that they are being watched by a vexed Kabuto, who claims that they are foiling Orochimaru's plan.",

  "description": "Naruto and Guren find themselves trapped in the belly of the Three-Tailed Turtle with no way out. Guren attempts to attack Naruto but passes out from her wound. She then has a nightmare about asking Yūkimaru's mother for forgiveness, only for an image of Orochimaru to tell her that she can never ask for that. As she comes to, she realises that her wound has been bandaged by Naruto. Asking why Naruto had not killed her when she was passed out, Naruto tells her that he would never strike somebody who was not capable of striking back. Guren tells him that nonetheless they would have to fight one another, as only one person would escape and find Yūkimaru. Their conversation, however, is cut short by the arrival of a horde of Three-Tails mini clones, and Naruto saves the wounded Guren from being devoured.\nOn land, Kakashi tasks Ino and Sakura with Yūkimaru's recovery while Shino, Lee and Tenten are to protect them in case Team Guren comes back for Yūkimaru. In the meantime, the others would begin their search for Naruto. Meanwhile, Kigiri, Nurari and Kihō are wounded from their battle and led to believe by Kabuto that they are near death. Eager for a chance to live, they beg him to save them, and he agrees on the condition that they retrieve Yūkimaru from the Orochimaru Search Team. In order to aid their quest, he gives them Orochimaru's cursed seals to grant them additional power.\nIn their hideout, Yūkimaru comes to and believes he has lost Guren's crystallised camellia, only to find it. Sakura realises that Guren is the one he considers his home; Yūkimaru then surprises them by stating that he innately knows where Naruto and Guren are, and that they are trapped within the belly of the Three-Tails. Within the beast, Guren wonders why Naruto would have saved her when he could have left her to be killed, and Naruto states that he had no desire to do so. Naruto reveals to Guren that he is responsible for Yūkimaru's attitude towards her, but that was only because he did not know he would consider a subordinate of Orochimaru's as his home. Guren retorts by stating that Orochimaru has need for one who could control a tailed beast and that Konoha is hypocritical, as they already possess the power of the Nine-Tails via a jinchūriki and simply want Yūkimaru to increase their military power. Naruto tells her that Konoha has no need for the Three-Tails and surprises Guren by telling her that he is the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails. Although Guren is conflicted with her loyalty towards Orochimaru, she tells Naruto that Yūkimaru is the one who thinks of her and therefore he is the one she would return to. Naruto, filled with a resolve that they both escape together, explains that they should split up to cover more ground as they need to find a way out. Guren rhetorically asks how much ground two people can cover, only for Naruto to conjure up a thousand shadow clones; Guren, Naruto and his shadow clones then run throughout the beast's stomach as they look for a way out.",

Naruto tells Guren to save herself while he attempts to fight off a big turtle clone, only for Guren to block an attack towards Naruto with her Crystal Release: Jade Crystal Blade. Finding a hole above them, Naruto picks up an embarrassed Guren and uses two shadow clones to propel them upwards. Guren asks Naruto why he saved her life and he retorts that he didn't have to, the same way that she didn't have to save him. Noticing her wound, he tells her to stay put as he attempts to find a way out, only to wander into an Illusionary Mist emitted by the Three-Tails. Within the mist, he sees an illusion of Sasuke, who proceeds to slash at him with his sword. As Naruto cries out for \"Sasuke\" to stop, Guren decides to interfere by jumping into the mist, where she confronts an illusion of Yūkimaru's mother, where she begs her for forgiveness and promises to atone for her sin by protecting Yūkimaru with her life. Having conquered her fear, the effect of the mist wears off on her as she locates Naruto and slaps him, undoing the genjutsu. Hearing him cry out Sasuke's name, she asks him if he is referring to Sasuke Uchiha; Naruto is surprised that she knows of him and she replies that she had seen him with Orochimaru many times. She is shocked when Naruto tells her that his goal is to rescue Sasuke from Orochimaru and begins to laugh as she recalls Sasuke's prowess and the idea of Naruto going up against him to rescue him.\nMeanwhile, the cursed seal enhanced members of Team Guren engage against Lee, Tenten, Kiba and Akamaru. On the surface of the lake, Yūkimaru has Sai drop camellias into the lake while Kakashi and Yamato use their Lightning Cutter and Wood Release to puncture a hole into the Three-Tails' barrier. This creates a hole inside the turtle, where both Naruto and Guren see the camellias floating, realising that Yūkimaru is showing them a way out. Before they escape, Guren tells Naruto that it was she who killed Yūkimaru's mother, under Orochimaru's orders, and that she would die saving Naruto so that he may protect Yūkimaru. Knowing that Guren is a changed person, he picks up Guren and heads towards the hole, using his Rasengan to blast it open.",

Team Guren, with enhanced strength due to their cursed seals, make quick work of Lee, Tenten, Kiba and Akamaru and move on to deal with Sai.

Kakashi, Shino and Yamato find themselves in combat against Team Guren; Kihō uses his Wrist Launcher to send a Smoke Dragon towards Yamato, but the latter counters with his Water Release: Water Bowl technique, which riddles the smoke with too much moisture, leaving Kihō unable to control it. Yamato then uses his Wood Release: Great Forest Technique to finish Kihō off. Kakashi is faced by Kigiri, who uses his Exploding Flame Shot to ignite Kakashi and then bind him with his Binding Smoke Prison. Believing Kakashi to be done for, he dispels all of his smoke clones, only for the Kakashi he trapped to be none other than a shadow clone while the real Kakashi strikes him from behind with his Lightning Cutter. In the meantime, using advice given by Hinata, Shino is able to ascertain Nurari's weakness and seemingly kills him. With Team Guren dealt with, the three shinobi are joined by Lee, Tenten.

Naruto tells her that even if Yūkimaru despises her, she must be there for him and protect him, which she agrees with. On the clifftop, Yūkimaru runs out of chakra and is unable to control the Three-Tails, prompting Rinji to attempt to inject him with Orochimaru's Juinjutsu to grant him the chakra needed. His attempt is blocked by Guren and Naruto, who arrive in time to save Yūkimaru. Faced with no other choice, Rinji tells Yūkimaru that Guren was the one who killed his mother and took away his home and that he should have his revenge by using the Three-Tails to kill her and destroy Konoha. However, Yūkimaru tells Guren that he forgives her and that he loves her; Guren responds that she loves him too and that she will always be with him, thankful that he has chosen to forgive her. Naruto then proceeds to punch Rinji in the face, only for Rinji's face to tear. \"Rinji\" then peels his face off, revealing himself to be none other than Kabuto, who warns Naruto that he would kill him if he does not stop interfering.",

  "description": "Kabuto explains that he had killed Rinji after the latter wanted to report directly to Orochimaru himself as Kabuto's equal. Using his Dead Soul Technique to summon Rinji's reanimated corpse, he has Rinji attack Guren. In order to protect Yūkimaru, Guren shields him with her Crystal Release: Crimson Fruit and attempts to fight Rinji, only to realise that Rinji's Bat Controlling: Ultrasonic Mind Waves renders her Crystal Release useless. Sneaking up behind him, she disables his arms and crystallises both of them, and they tumble off the cliff and into the ocean. Believing Guren has died, Yūkimaru's anger and rage increases as he summons the Three-Tailed Turtle. The power boost causes the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier to break as the turtle goes on a rampage.\nThe Orochimaru Search Team find themselves about to be attacked by Nurari, who has absorbed the corpses of his two comrades. Kakashi intructs Yamato to bind Nurari with his Wood Release while he strikes it with his Lightning Cutter; Kakashi, however, is forced to abandon his attack and move out of the way as the Three-Tails breaches out of the water and eliminates Nurari. Kabuto, glad that Orochimaru's plan of using Guren to ignite Yūkimaru's rage has worked in another way, departs in glee, leaving Naruto to deal with the enraged Yūkimaru. As there is a barrier preventing him from reaching Yūkimaru and the Three-Tails is heading their way, Naruto decides to deal with the tailed beast on his own.\nDue to the fact that his Rasengan fails to land a blow and his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken is forbidden, he summons Gamakichi and Gamatatsu in order to use his Wind Release: Toad Gun. However, Gamakichi reminds him to use his head, as the turtle is amphibious and lives in a lake and would not be affected by a Water Release technique, even it is augmented by Wind Release. Naruto remembers his training with Yamato, in which Yamato had told him about Nature Transformation and how each elements had their weaknesses, and how he was a perfect match for Sasuke since his wind would augment Sasuke's Fire Release. He exclaims that he has a plan to combine his wind with fire before realising that none of them possess fire and that fire does not beat water. Gamakichi, however, tells him that he knows how to use Fire Release and that fire with a high enough intensity should be able to evaporate water.\nUnder Gamakichi's instructions, Gamatatsu heads back home in order to ingest toad oil as Naruto summons him back a minute later. Using the same principle behind his Wind Release: Toad Gun, Naruto infuses his wind chakra with Gamatatsu's Toad Oil Bullet to create a new cooperation ninjutsu technique — Wind Release: Toad Oil Bullet. They then aim their technique towards the Three-Tails' weak spot, his eye, only for the Three-Tails to counter with his Water Release: Great Water Mass Bullet. Gamakichi uses his Fire Release: Flame Bullet in conjunction with Naruto and Gamatatsu's to create another new technique — Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet. The three-way collaborative technique proves hot enough to evaporate the Three-Tails attack and to temporarily defeat it. With their problem being dealt with for the time being, the toads dispel themselves as the barrier surrounding Yūkimaru fades away.",

  "description": "As Sakura heals Ino's wounds, Shizune and Hinata tend to Yūkimaru, whose Chakra Pathway System has been severely disrupted, causing him to lose the power over the Three-Tails permanently. Katsuyu, using her Slug Great Division to have one body in Tsunade's office and the other at the Orochimaru Search Team's hideout, relays Tsunade's orders that they are to return to Konoha the following morning as she sends an Anbu team to relieve them. As Yūkimaru sleeps that night, he has a vision of Guren being rescued by Gozu; during his time as one of Orochimaru's failed experiments, the sannin had left him to die until Guren had given him a ladle of water, hence explaining his loyalty and gratefulness towards her. In the middle of the night, Yūkimaru gets up and leaves the hideout in order to be with them. Naruto wakes up to see Yūkimaru gone and chases after him, while Yamato and Kakashi decide not to follow him. Naruto spots Guren's crystallised camellia and realises that there are no cracks in it, meaning that Guren is alive. Knowing that Yūkimaru is with her, Naruto uncharacteristically voices his opinion towards the team that they have no need to find Yūkimaru as he is fine; Shino and Kakashi add that Yūkimaru's importance to Konoha has been dissolved after he lost his ability to control the Three-Tails and that it is not their job to go after runaways.\nKabuto returns back home, where he tells Orochimaru that Guren has been killed and that Yūkimaru has lost his powers, apologising for not securing the Three-Tails. As Orochimaru begins to cough relentlessly, Kabuto rushes off to retrieve his medicine while musing that Orochimaru's current host has reached its limits; Orochimaru smiles as he relishes the thought of finally being able to take over Sasuke's body. Meanwhile, Deidara overhears the Anbu mentioning that the mist caused by the Three-Tails can induce hallucinations. Thanking them for the tip, he proceeds to kill them all with his Explosive Clay. He then flies over the lake on his clay bird while dropping his detonating clay spiders into the lake to disrupt and summon the tailed beast. As the Three-Tails emerges, Deidara tasks Tobi with the duty of acquiring it, which Tobi is unable to do. As Tobi is taken underwater by Deidara, Deidara uses his C1 to flip the turtle on its back and knock it out. Having defeated the turtle, Deidara uses two clay birds and ropes to tow the tailed beast back to the Akatsuki's hideout.",

He tells Kabuto that he knew that Sasuke was the perfect host body for him when he witnessed Sasuke activate his Sharingan and combine the Manipulating Windmill Triple Blades along with his Fire Release: Dragon Fire Technique to burn him when he was using Shiore's body; subsequently, he remembers how he had given Sasuke the Cursed Seal of Heaven and had encountered Anko shortly after that. Orochimaru goes on to reminisce about Sasuke had fared in his match against Yoroi Akadō, and how Yoroi had begun using his chakra absorption in an attempt to draw out Sasuke's cursed seal, only for Sasuke to repress it with willpower and defeat Yoroi with his Lion Combo. Kabuto remarks that this is when Orochimaru had decided to stick around and witness the rest of the exams, which Orochimaru claimed was a good idea as Sasuke had improved considerably by his second match, in which he had used the Chidori against Gaara. As Orochimaru continues to hack up blood, Kabuto excuses himself to fetch more medicine.\nKabuto muses how Orochimaru is the only person he'd always be loyal to and faithfully serve, recalling Orochimaru's attack on Konoha, how he managed to kill the Third Hokage and the Fourth Kazekage, and the fact that he was able go up against both Jiraiya and Tsunade. In Konoha, Tsunade is told by an Anbu that the squad sent to the lake have disappeared and that the Three-Tails is no longer there, prompting the Hokage to dispatch another squad. Concurrently, Sasuke remembers observing Itachi perfectly hit all targets with his shurikenjutsu and manages to obliterate all of his targets with his Chidori Current. Satisfied with his progress, he walks to Orochimaru's room, where he uses his Chidori Sharp Spear to go through the door in an attempt to impale Orochimaru's heart. Orochimaru manages to block the attack with his forearms and marvels at the perfect use of both shape and nature transformation as Sasuke uses his sword to slice through the door. He tells Orochimaru that the sannin has nothing left to teach him and reveals that he had all intentions of giving up his body but does not wish to do so now that he is stronger than Orochimaru. He notes that he was always aware that all Orochimaru wanted was the power of the Uchiha Clan and the Sharingan but was no match for Itachi, and thus chose to go after the \"baby of the clan\". He adds that he finds Orochimaru's need for experiments on humans and ingestion of strange medicines in order to disrupt nature disgusting and that his efforts to become all-powerful and reach the level of Uchiha as pathetic, and even states that in his eyes Orochimaru along with other geniuses could never hope to match the prowess and talents of the Uchiha clan and are merely average compared to the Uchiha. Enraged, Orochimaru reveals his true form to Sasuke and attempts to steal his body, only for Sasuke to slice away all the snakes that bind him. Activating his cursed seal to the second stage, he tells Orochimaru that the latter is like a snake who was confined to the ground and wished to fly, and thus nurtured a baby bird in his own nest, only for the baby bird to grow into a hawk that will hunt the snake; Orochimaru then lunges at Sasuke in a rage.",

  "description": "As Sasuke fights Orochimaru's true form with his Cursed Seal of Heaven's second stage, Orochimaru thinks back upon his past. At a young age, he found the shed skin of a white snake, and asked his sensei, the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, what it meant. Hiruzen had told him that the white snake's skin was rare and that it was renown as a sign of good luck and renewal, possibly meaning that his parents may be reborn someday. Years later, during a mission, he witnessed Tsunade's brother Nawaki dying and remarked that the lifespan and vulnerability of humans were weaknesses, and eventually began seeking out a reanimation technique. Some time later, he had gained Anko as an apprentice, who had noticed the white snake skin Orochimaru had kept. He had told her that he was experimenting not only with reanimation but also with regeneration. During this time, he also witnessed Itachi Uchiha's prowess with the Sharingan and began to covet the power of the Uchiha clan's kekkei genkai. Soon after finding various scrolls in a tome, he had realised that there was no way one could learn and master all the forbidden techniques in a single lifespan and thus focused on mastering the Living Corpse Reincarnation technique in an attempt to gain immortality. However, he had later been caught doing experiments with the dead by the Third Hokage, and thus fled Konoha, although not before engaging in a battle with his old teammate Jiraiya.\nAfter having escaped from Jiraiya, Orochimaru had joined the criminal organisation known as the Akatsuki and was pleasantly surprised to have learned that their new member and his partner was none other than Itachi himself. He had then attempted to use his transference technique in an attempt to steal Itachi's body, only for Itachi to effortlessly trap him in a genjutsu with his Sharingan. Trapped within the Demonic Illusion: Shackling Stakes Technique, Itachi proceeded to cut off Orochimaru's left arm before he could try to dispel the genjutsu and had told the sannin that there was no techniques he could use that his Sharingan would not see through. After that, Orochimaru had deserted the Akatsuki and lay in wait as Sasuke came to him, believing that Sasuke would be his future host body.\nIn the present day, Sasuke manages to use his sword to slice through Orochimaru's snake form, wondering if the battle is over and stating that it was a disappointment. As his curse mark recedes, Orochimaru laughs as the toxic fumes emitted from his body paralyses Sasuke. With Sasuke weakened, Orochimaru initiates his immortality jutsu, intent on finally taking Sasuke's body for his own. Kabuto, who had been elsewhere preparing medicine, notices that Orochimaru's door is destroyed and peeks inside to see Sasuke's body standing up while the white snake is on the floor. He wonders whether the Sasuke in front of him is the real Sasuke or Orochimaru, only for Sasuke to use his Sharingan on Kabuto to show him what had happened.\nWhile Orochimaru had transported himself and Sasuke to a mental plane in order to take over his body, Sasuke had used his Sharingan to reverse the effects of Orochimaru's technique, eroding the environment. He had repeated Itachi's words to Orochimaru on how his Sharingan was able to see through any of his techniques, and proceeded to absorb Orochimaru's remains. Kabuto is shocked to discover that Orochimaru is now effectively gone, while Sasuke triumphantly leaves the hideout with a smirk on his face.\nIn Konoha, Naruto, Tsunade and Jiraiya notice the blood red sunset and consider it a bad omen; while on a mission, Anko hears a rustling sound and throws a kunai in its direction, only to pin and kill a white snake. Remembering Orochimaru, she then clutches at her cursed seal. Concurrently, Itachi and Kisame are on a walk when Itachi notices the blood red sunset as well.",

  "description": "Sometime in the past, Sasuke had told Suigetsu Hōzuki, a prisoner of Orochimaru's, that he would free him one day. After having killed Orochimaru, Sasuke makes good on his promise and frees Suigetsu from his water tank. After being freed, Sasuke tells Suigetsu that he is the first member to be added to a team he is forming, along with Karin of the Southern Hideout and Jūgo of the Northern Hideout. Suigetsu shows no desire to join Sasuke's team at first, but decides to join under the condition that Sasuke help him find Kubikiribōchō, the sword of Zabuza Momochi, who was one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, since it was Sasuke's squad that defeated Zabuza.\nSasuke and Suigetsu head to the Land of Waves, where Sasuke notices that the name of the bridge is called the Great Naruto Bridge. Suigetsu asks whether Zabuza was tough, and Sasuke recalls his first encounter with Zabuza, as well as when Zabuza trapped Kakashi inside of his Water Prison Technique. Sasuke is snapped out of his reverie by Suigetsu and merely crosses the bridge and enters the village, where they nearly get into a fight with a rude villager. After heading to Zabuza and Haku's Grave, they discover that Kubikiribōchō, which Kakashi had buried there along with Zabuza, is missing. After heading to a village restaurant, Suigetsu notices all the girls there fawning over Sasuke and tells them that Sasuke is looking for the blade, prompting them all to tell him that Tazuna knows its location. Sasuke remembers meeting him and tells Suigetsu that Tazuna was the bridge builder who built the Great Naruto Bridge. However, when they get to Tazuna's house, they discover that both he and his grandson Inari left for the Land of Lightning and would not return for a year; however, a worker there does tell them that he knows the whereabouts of Kubikiribōchō, and that it is in the possession of a corrupt boss named Tenzen Daikoku.\nIn the village, Suigetsu and Sasuke come across the rude villager once more and Suigetsu threatens him to give up Tenzen's location. That night, Sasuke infiltrates the castle and points his sword at Tenzen, telling him that his name is Suigetsu and that he would attack tomorrow with an army, and to have tens of thousands of men ready. As Tenzen rallies his troops, Sasuke merely tells Suigetsu that there is a rival group clashing against Tenzen and that he should use the opportunity to seize Kubikiribōchō. Sasuke makes a wager with Suigetsu in which they deal with Tenzen's men without killing any of them and enters into the fray, defeating one half with ease. As the other half approaches, Sasuke disappears, leaving Suigetsu to deal with them. Suigetsu is able to easily defeat them and heads inside the mansion, only to be bisected by Tenzen's Bodyguard, who wields the Kubikiribōchō.\nUtilising his Hydrification Technique to liquefy and rejoin his bottom half, Suigetsu tells them that he cannot be harmed by blades. He then uses his Water Release: Great Water Arm Technique to pry Zabuza's blade out of the bodyguard's arms, sending the bodyguard flying. Suigetsu wishes to kill Tenzen as Tenzen has been spreading rumours that he was the one who killed Zabuza, only to be interrupted by Sasuke, who convinces Suigetsu not to kill him. As Suigetsu destroys the pillars around the house to give Tenzen a chance to live, Tenzen demands to know whether this Sasuke is the very one who killed Orochimaru, surprising Suigetsu that the word has already spread. As the duo leave the Land of Waves, Suigetsu realises that Sasuke knew the blade had been taken and had set up the whole thing with Tenzen's army in order for Sasuke to test his strength. They then head to the Southern Hideout, where Karin is located, who manages to knock a man out after stating that Orochimaru's death does not grant him the right to do whatever he pleases. However, she quickly senses a powerful and frightening chakra nearby.",

  "description": "Sasuke and Suigetsu head towards the Southern Hideout, one of Orochimaru's bases, where the prisoners are being guarded by a warden named Karin. Sasuke tells Suigetsu that his plan is to recruit Karin for his team. Suigetsu asks why he is putting together a team and why he would want Karin on it, as he finds her unpleasant and difficult to deal with. Sasuke responds that he had been thinking of forming a team for quite some time now as it would help him further his goals, and tells Suigetsu that Karin has a special ability which makes her unique. At the hideout, Karin manages to sense their chakra before the duo arrive.\nSuigetsu uses his Kubikiribōchō to break down the door of the hideout and the pair enter, walking by prisoners, who were discussing whether the rumors of Orochimaru's death were true. After seeing Sasuke walk inside without Orochimaru, they begin to believe in the validity of the rumors, although some refuse to believe it. Sasuke and Suigetsu run into Karin, and they decide to talk in a separate room. Karin refuses Sasuke's offer, claiming that her place is to be the warden of the prison and asks whether Sasuke had truly killed Orochimaru. Sasuke confirms her doubt, and Suigetsu states that word of Orochimaru's death should have already reached the prison and Sasuke reveals that he had noticed freshly dug graves outside as he was walking in; Suigetsu pieces together that Karin had a spy located in the cells and was killing off any prisoners who were discussing Orochimaru's fate. Sasuke then asks Suigetsu to free the prisoners; as Suigetsu leaves, Karin locks herself inside the room with Sasuke.\nSuigetsu gets to the cells, where he promises to free all the prisoners so long as they spread the word that Sasuke took down Orochimaru and subsequently freed them, to which the prisoners hastily agree. Inside the room, Karin removes her glasses and changes her tone to a seductive voice, attempting to nuzzle next to Sasuke and agreeing to join his team. She recalls their first encounter, in which Orochimaru had tasked Sasuke to retrieve escaped prisoners and had ordered Karin to use her special chakra sensing ability in order to assist him. Karin had noticed that Sasuke had not killed anyone, and Sasuke had responded that there was only one person whom he wanted to kill. Karin noticed Sasuke's chakra at those words and was excited by it, and ended up distracted. When her distraction leads her to fall off a tree, Sasuke saved her and killed a prisoner who was attempting to use the chance to take out Karin.\nAs Sasuke tells Karin not to get too close to him, Suigetsu uses his Water Release: Great Water Arm Technique along with his Kubikiribōchō to break down the door. Sasuke alerts Suigetsu that Karin had accepted his proposal, but with the arrival of Suigetsu, Karin puts her glasses back on and reverts to her old, cold tone, telling them that she had never agreed to do such a thing. However, with no prisoners to keep watch over and her growing attraction towards Sasuke, she tells them that she is headed in the same direction as they are and thus would be joining them for part of the way. The three then set off to recruit the final member of the team — Jūgo, who is shackled in the Northern Hideout.",

  "description": "Sasuke, Karin and Suigetsu head to the Northern Hideout, where they plan to recruit Jūgo. Karin warns them that Jūgo is an individual with repressed maniacal urges who becomes homicidal when he snaps, and that Orochimaru extracted fluids secreted from his enzymes in order to create his cursed seals. At the hideout, they discover that the guard is missing and are subsequently attacked by a prisoner, who is in the second stage of his cursed seal. Having killed all the guards, the prisoner decides to attack Sasuke, only for Sasuke to cut him down with his sword. As they enter the hideout, they are faced with various other prisoners also in the second stage of their cursed seals, and Sasuke asks Suigetsu to deal with them without killing them.\nAs Jūgo sits in his cell, he recalls on how he was once cooled off during a murderous rampage by Kimimaro, who had promised him that he would be there for him. Musing that Kimimaro is no longer with him, Jūgo constantly states that if a man were to walk through the door, he would kill him, only to continuously state that he would do the same if it were a woman. As Sasuke's team make their way through the hideout, Karin sends Suigetsu down the wrong hallway in order to be alone with Sasuke, and leads him to Jūgo's cell. As Karin unlocks the door, Jūgo states that if it is a woman, he would kill her; however, just as she is about to open the door, Jūgo claims that he would kill whomever if it is a man, and is greeted by Sasuke, who opens the door. Jūgo enters into a partial transformation and attacks Sasuke, who also undergoes a partial transformation into the second stage of his cursed seal. Repelling Jūgo's attack, Sasuke tells Jūgo that he is not here to fight but to merely talk to him.\nIn Konoha, Naruto and Sakura are summoned to Tsunade's office, where both she and Jiraiya tell the duo that Orochimaru has been killed by Sasuke. As Sakura wells up in tears, Naruto cheerfully exclaims that he knew Sasuke would not lose to Orochimaru and proudly asks whether this means Sasuke would be returning to the village, only for Jiraiya to tell him that returning to Konoha isn't part of Sasuke's plan.",

  "description": "Sasuke reminds Jūgo that he is not here to fight, but to simply talk to him and recruit him to join his team. Jūgo claims that he cannot leave the Northern Hideout without Kimimaro and continues to attack Sasuke. It turns out that in the past, it was Kimimaro who had recruited Jūgo to join Orochimaru and had promised to restrain Jūgo's murderous impulses with his Shikotsumyaku acting as a cage. Suigetsu arrives, and is told by Karin that Jūgo is bipolar and relied on Kimimaro to help him, and thus had joined Orochimaru willingly in order to find a way to repress his urges. As Sasuke attempts to avoid Jūgo's attacks, Suigetsu interferes, blocking the strike with his Kubikiribōchō. Jūgo retaliates with his Destroying Axe Fist but the pair are stopped by Sasuke's Binding Snake Glare Spell, asking them if they both wish to die.\nThe restraint causes Jūgo to revert back to normal and he rushes into his cell, asking Sasuke to lock the door and leave, as he does not want to kill people anymore. Sasuke tells Jūgo that he would not kill people as he would protect Jūgo and act as his cage, mirroring Kimimaro's words. When Jūgo reminds Sasuke that he cannot leave without Kimimaro, Sasuke tells him that Kimimaro had died for him. Jūgo then recalls the last time he had seen Kimimaro, when the latter told him that he was heading to retrieve Sasuke, who was to be Orochimaru's vessel. As only he and Sasuke were considered to be Orochimaru's prime host bodies, Kimimaro told Jūgo that he considered Sasuke as his \"reincarnation\". Jūgo then opens his cell door and exits. Outside, Sasuke tells them that his goal is to murder Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki and that they are to help him reach his goal. However, he offers them all the choice to join him. Karin tells Sasuke that she has nothing else to do, while Suigetsu chides her for hiding her true feelings about wanting to be around Sasuke; however, he too agrees to join as he wishes to fight Kisame Hoshigaki and claim his Samehada. Jūgo joins the team as well, wanting to see what kind of shinobi Sasuke is, as his best friend Kimimaro considered Sasuke his \"reincarnation\". Sasuke then dubs their team as \"Hebi\".\nIn Konoha, Jiraiya tells Naruto that Sasuke would not be returning to the village as his goal is still to exact vengeance upon Itachi. Wanting to find Sasuke and knowing that Konoha is conducting a search for the Akatsuki, Naruto proposes that the best way to reach Sasuke is for them to find Itachi first.",

  "description": "Obito Uchiha rushes to a clearing where his teammate Kakashi Hatake admonishes him for being late, declaring that the shinobi rules of conduct state that a shinobi is to be on time. The team's leader, Minato Namikaze, tells them they have a new mission, and that since Kakashi has just become a jōnin, he would be leading himself, Obito and their other teammate Rin Nohara while he goes on his own mission. In order to celebrate Kakashi's promotion, Minato gives Kakashi a Flying Thunder God Kunai while Rin gives him a specially made medic-kit. Obito, however, has forgotten to bring a gift for Kakashi and is vexed when Kakashi states that it would have been useless anyways.\nMinato tells them that as they are involved in a war, Iwagakure has invaded Kusagakure near the Land of Fire and that Kakashi's team are to destroy the Kannabi Bridge in order to cripple their efforts. Meanwhile, he would engage in combat in the front lines in order to provide a suitable distraction. On their way, Kakashi spots Mahiru, an Iwa-nin who is conducting surveillance. Minato notices that Mahiru has employed about twenty shadow clones while Kakashi tells him that he has a new technique that should be able to deal with them all. With his Chidori, Kakashi plows through the shadow clones and rushes towards the real Mahiru; however, Kakashi's Chidori causes him to have tunnel vision and thus does not see Mahiru pull out a sword. Before Mahiru can kill Kakashi, Minato manages to save him from the blow whilst simultaneously marking Mahiru's foot, although Kakashi ends up being slashed near his underarm.\nAs Rin tends to Kakashi's wounds, Minato uses his Flying Thunder God Technique to appear before Mahiru, placing a kunai next to the Iwa-nin's throat. Mahiru expresses his regret for recognising Minato as the famed \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\" and for not retreating as per Iwagakure's rules; Minato then kills Mahiru. As they camp that night, Obito expresses his displeasure of being a failure from the elite Uchiha Clan while having to deal with Kakashi's genius. Minato reveals that Kakashi is the way he is because his father Sakumo, who was known as the \"Konoha's White Fang\", had once broken the law by choosing to save the lives of his comrades over completing the mission and was thus vilified by both the village and the very friends he had saved. Unable to cope, Sakumo took his own life. Since then, Kakashi had chosen never to speak of his father and vowed to uphold the rules and regulations of the shinobi world.\nThe following morning, Minato sets off on his own mission while Obito decides to pledge his loyalty to his new captain, Kakashi, much to the team's surprise. On their way to the bridge, they are spotted by two enemies from Iwa. While one of them distracts Kakashi and Obito, the other uses a camouflage technique to abduct Rin. Obito claims that they should go and save Rin, only for Kakashi to remind him that the law is to complete the mission even at the expense of their comrades, and that they should not let emotions cloud their judgment. Obito declares that he will not follow Kakashi's orders, and as he walks away, he tells Kakashi that he personally views the White Fang as a hero; he also adds that while shinobi who break the rules are considered scum, those who abandon their friends are worse than scum. The duo then part their separate ways.",

  "description": "As Kakashi heads through the woods to Kannabi Bridge, he flinches in pain from his wound. Recalling Rin healing his wounds and Obito's steadfast decision to abandon the mission to save her, Kakashi begins to consider his choices. Meanwhile, Obito manages to locate the two Iwa-nin outside their cave. As he slaps his face in order to focus, the sound carries throughout the cave, alerting the ninja to his presence. Taiseki decides to deal with Obito while Kakkō continues using his Interrogation Genjutsu on Rin in an attempt to break her. Using his Hiding with Camouflage Technique, Taiseki sneaks up on Obito and prepares to kill him with a kunai, only for Kakashi to interfere and slash at Taiseki with his White Light Chakra Sabre. Seeing the sabre and the white hair, he wonders whether Kakashi is the Konoha's famed \"White Fang\", only to realise that he is just his son. As Obito questions why Kakashi would come and save him, Taiseki uses his camouflage technique once more and sneaks up on Obito; Kakashi attempts to save him but ends up getting his left eye slashed. As Kakashi reels in pain, Taiseki rushes towards Obito, only for Obito to turn around and stab him with a kunai. Kakashi and Taiseki wonder how Obito was able to see the latter, and Obito realises that he has finally awoken his Sharingan. Using the med-kit given by Rin, Kakashi bandages his left eye and the two head inside the cave to save Rin.\nInside the cave, Obito is able to use his Sharingan to keep up with Kakashi and avoid being struck by Kakkō, and the duo manage to defeat him. As they rush to free Rin, Kakkō uses the opportunity to cause a cave-in. As Team Minato attempt to run out of the cave, Kakashi is struck by a falling rock. Obito picks Kakashi up and notices a big boulder above their head, and throws Kakashi out of the way, taking the brunt of the boulder's impact on himself. As Kakashi and Rin come to, they discover Obito pinned underneath the boulder, the entire left side of his body crushed. Kakashi begins to cry, as he believes he could have prevented this had he chosen to follow Obito at the beginning and that it did not matter that he was jōnin and thus captain of the team. Remembering that he had not given Kakashi a gift for his promotion, he asks Rin to transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi's left eye socket. With the transplant completed, Kakashi rushes outside the cave and uses his White Light Chakra Sabre to attack Kakkō. As Kakkō destroys the blade, Kakashi uses his Chidori to strike the Iwa-nin and kills him. As the other Iwa-nin arrive, one of them uses his Earth Release: Tearing Earth Turning Palm cause the entire cave to collapse; Kakashi escapes with Rin as Obito is buried in the rubble, where he muses in his last moments that he is saddened to die right when he and Kakashi had finally begun to get along and that he never told Rin that he loved her. Outside, Kakashi and Rin are ambushed by the surrounding Iwa-nin, and Kakashi tells Rin to flee while he fights them off, as he had promised Obito that he would protect Rin with his life. Kakashi tells Rin that Obito had loved her and that she was everything to him, as Rin attempts to tell Kakashi that she has feelings for him. As Kakashi prepares his Chidori, they are saved by the arrival of Minato, who uses his Flying Thunder God Technique to defeat all of their enemies.\nAs he comes to, Kakashi asks how Minato had arrived to save them and Minato reveals that the marking on the Flying Thunder God Kunai he had given Kakashi allows him to teleport to that location; he also adds that Rin had told him what had transpired. Following the destruction of the Kannabi Bridge, the Third Hokage declared that two heroes were born that day, each with their own Sharingan. Obito had received his own memorial as a shinobi who had died during the Third Shinobi World War while Kakashi earned the moniker \"Kakashi of the Sharingan\".",

  "description": "Kisame of the Akatsuki goes up against the Four-Tails' jinchūriki, countering the jinchūriki's Lava Release with his Water Release to emerge victorious. Following the battle, he meets his partner Itachi on a clifftop. Itachi tells Kisame that they are to head to the hideout immediately so that they can begin sealing both the Three-Tails and the Four-Tails. As they reach the woods, they are both telepathically summoned to their leader's hideout.\nAt the hideout, their leader summons the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the surviving members take their respective places. Before they begin the sealing process, the leader and Zetsu notify the Akatsuki members that Orochimaru has been killed. Deidara voices his discomfort over the news, as he wanted to be the one to kill the sannin. Kisame claims that Orochimaru's death is not their concern as he left the Akatsuki ten years ago, and that he himself did not care for the deaths of Hidan and Kakuzu, and wonders who finished them off. Zetsu tells them that it was the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki and his team who defeated Kakuzu and Hidan and that it was Sasuke Uchiha who killed Orochimaru. The leader also adds his fear that Sasuke may wage war against the entirety of the Akatsuki soon, while Zetsu notifies them that Sasuke has formed a team, whose members include Suigetsu Hōzuki of Kirigakure. Knowing that Sasuke is after Itachi and that Suigetsu is after Kisame, the leader tells the pair to be on their guard; they then begin the sealing process of the two tailed beasts in their possession.\nAfter the sealing process is complete, Deidara contemplates who his target shall be, claiming that he wishes to settle the score with Naruto for punching him in the face as well as Kakashi for having removed his right arm, and that he wishes to take out Sasuke as punishment for robbing him of the chance of eliminating Orochimaru. Meanwhile, Sasuke's team Hebi make their way to an Uchiha Clan munitions base, run by an old woman who goes by Nekobaa. Nekobaa expresses her thoughts over Sasuke and Itachi fighting each other to the death, as she had known both of them since they were young.\nIn Konoha, Tsunade contemplates Naruto's idea to apprehend Itachi in order to bring Sasuke back to the village. Kakashi claims he has an idea, and asks to be excused alone with the two Sannin in the room. Shortly after, Tsunade makes the Itachi Pursuit Mission official as Kakashi forms an Eight Man Squad for the task, consisting of Team 7 under Yamato's command and Team 8 under his own command.",

  "description": "Kakashi splits the Eight Man Squad into smaller sub-teams, each of them paired with two ninja hounds with the exception of Kiba and Kakashi, who have Akamaru and Pakkun as their respective partners. Their task is to find the location of Sasuke or Itachi and report back. In the meantime, Sasuke assigns individual tasks to each member of Hebi in hopes of finding a way to Itachi.\nDue to the fact that he is a jinchūriki and thus a target of the Akatsuki, Naruto is given additional protection in the form of Yamato and Hinata as well as being assigned Bull, the biggest hound in Kakashi's pack. Elsewhere, Deidara and Tobi begin their search for either Naruto, Kakashi or Sasuke. While riding on one of his clay birds, Deidara claims to have spotted one of them, although he keeps the identity of whom a secret from Tobi.\nWhile Suigetsu locates Kyōya and Ginji, the accountant and banker of Akatsuki member Kakuzu, Karin is sent to a village to find a clue to the Akatsuki's whereabouts. Unbeknownst to her, Sakura is in the same village, with Bisuke and Shiba managing to locate Sasuke's scent, which is coming from Karin. However, Karin and Sakura pass each other and the scent is lost. Naruto, Yamato and Hinata are ambushed by Kabuto, who gives them Orochimaru's gathered intelligence on the Akatsuki. When asked why he would give up such a thing, Kabuto tells Naruto that he is grateful towards him; ever since Kabuto was a child, he was used as a spy and thus moved from village to village until he became Orochimaru's subordinate. After Orochimaru had died, he felt as though he had lost his purpose and identity until he realised that Naruto had forged his own identity when the villagers thought he was no more than a human variant of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Kabuto reveals the left side of his body to the trio, which resembles Orochimaru, and explains that he had grafted portions of Orochimaru's corpse onto himself as a way of clinging to his dead master and that he plans to avenge Orochimaru by eliminating Sasuke. With that said, Kabuto flees, evading capture.\nIn a clearing, Sasuke senses Tobi's presence and notices Deidara flying above him, the latter dropping two C1 bombs on him. Believing they have killed him, they realise that Sasuke summoned a snake to shield him from the damage. With his Sharingan activated, Sasuke glares at Deidara, who stares back.",

  "description": "Deidara is irritated at the fact that Sasuke killed Orochimaru, claiming that he was only able to do so because he was born into the Uchiha clan. Using his sword, Sasuke rushes at Deidara and Tobi; Deidara leaps on a tree branch to evade the attack while Tobi is sliced through, although he is unharmed by the attack. Using his explosive clay to create C1 clay spiders, he attacks Sasuke, who uses his Chidori Senbon to take out the spiders. Deidara then ups the ante by using Explosive Clay Dolls. Sasuke attempts to impale them with his sword, only for the sword to get stuck. Relying on taijutsu for a while, Sasuke applies his Lightning Release to his sword to slice through both clay dolls. However, the bisected dolls begin to reemerge as smaller versions, all of them chasing Sasuke through the forest. As they envelop Sasuke, Deidara detonates them, but Sasuke evades the blow with a Body Replacement Technique.\nDeidara decides to use his C2 and moulds his C2 Clay Dragon, regurgitating C2 landmines and taking flight. In an attempt to ground the bird, Sasuke attempts to impale it with his Chidori Sharp Spear, only to be out of range whilst simultaneously revealing its five metre limit to Deidara. Deidara accuses Sasuke of using Kakashi's technique, although he gives credit for the shape transformation Sasuke had applied to it. Tobi, under Deidara's command, places Explosive Landmines all around the ground while the C2 dragon fires clay missiles towards Sasuke, forcing the latter to enter into the second stage of his cursed seal in order to use the wings it grants to fly away from danger.\nNoticing that Sasuke's leg seems injured, Deidara fires another projectile missile at Sasuke, who uses his left wing to shield himself from it, albeit losing the wing in the process. Seeing as Sasuke is unable to fly without his wing, Deidara lowers his altitude slightly while Sasuke uses the Manipulated Shuriken Technique to throw two giant shuriken at him, who dodges it. Throwing his sword with precise accuracy to impale the ground, Sasuke uses it as a foothold and then leaps into the air, using the height gained to further the reach of his Chidori Sharp Spear, successfully slicing Deidara's C2 Clay Dragon in two. Pulling the wire threads he had used to manipulate the two shuriken, Sasuke impales both of Deidara's forearms, pinning him to the dragon which then explodes.\nDeidara survives the explosion, having created a clay bird, and glares at Sasuke and his Sharingan. He recalls when he was coerced into joining the Akatsuki by Itachi, and how he had developed a hatred for both the Sharingan and Itachi since. Deidara then uses the most powerful clay in his arsenal, the C4, and fashions it into a giant clay version of himself, while musing that his original intention was to use the C4 Karura to kill Itachi.",

  "description": "Unleashing his C4 Karura, Deidara unleashes miniature nano-sized explosive clay bombs that disintegrate cells from within, thus instantly killing the individual. He believes that he has killed Sasuke in that manner, only for Sasuke to have used Genjutsu: Sharingan to trick Deidara. Having entered into the second stage of his cursed seal, Sasuke strikes Deidara from behind with his Chidori, intentionally missing Deidara's vital spots in order to question him about Itachi's whereabouts. When Deidara inquires as to how Sasuke had evaded the attack, Sasuke reveals that his Sharingan sees chakra as colours and thus was able to see the nano-bombs.\nHowever, the Deidara Sasuke has in his grip is none other than a Clay Clone, while the real Deidara pops out of the clay bird and holds Sasuke's feet. Using his mouth to create another C4 Karura, Deidara has Sasuke trapped inside while leaping off the bird. Sasuke uses his Chidori to escape the Karura, although the C4 nano-bombs are already within Sasuke's system; Deidara then denotaes the C4, believing he has finally killed Sasuke.\nSasuke, nonetheless, survives the attack and punches Deidara, demanding to know Itachi's whereabouts. When Deidara questions how he had survived, Sasuke explains that he had seen Deidara's hand signs with his Sharingan and thus realised it was an Earth Release technique, which is vulnerable to Lightning Release. Sasuke reveals that he had tested the theory out when he had struck Deidara's clay spiders with his Chidori Senbon; however, due to Tobi being near the spiders' range, he was not sure whether it was his attack or Deidara that had prevented the spiders' detonation. Hence, he had tried it once more when he had infused his Chidori into his sword to pierce a landmine, which was not under Deidara's control. When the landmine did not explode, Sasuke's theory was confirmed, and thus he had struck himself with his own Chidori to disable the nano-bombs in his system; he also takes the opportunity to correct Deidara by telling him that he uses the Chidori, not the Lightning Cutter, which Deidara had been referring to it as during their battle. Along with that, he also reveals even if it didn't work, he has another hidden technique to be used, leaving Deidara in begrudging shock of Sasuke's abilities.\nHowever, Sasuke has ran out of chakra and collapses after negating a surprise attack from Deidara, who delightfully laughs as he still has some Explosive Clay left and declares this fight as his but is left incensed that Sasuke remains unworried. His composure utterly broken, Deidara shouts on how he despises Sasuke and Itachi for their cool and calm demeanour and how they used their dojutsu to just so easily handle and judge his art, which doesn't faze Sasuke, who simply asks him where Itachi is and even went as far as to deactivate his Sharingan, leaving Deidara even more furious. Deidara proceeds to pull his shirt off and uses the teeth in his palm to pull apart strings located above his heart, revealing another mouth. Ingesting his C0 clay, Deidara decides to detonate himself, telling Sasuke that the range of his attack goes up to 10 kilometres and that both he and Sasuke would die as a result, taking gleeful joy that while he would remembered for his explosive art, which would cause a crater in the very earth itself, Sasuke would be forgotten. Deidara then proceeds to detonate himself, claiming that true art is an explosion.",

  "description": "As Deidara blows himself up with his suicide attack, the explosion is seen across the neighbouring lands, prompting all members of the Eight Man Squad and Hebi to rush towards it. Zetsu, a member of the Akatsuki, witnesses Deidara's explosion, and judging by the blasts, believes that Sasuke and Tobi have died as well. Zetsu reports this to the other Akatsuki members and the Akatsuki leader asks them to mourn. Kisame expresses that while he misses Tobi, at least Deidara had taken Sasuke out with him. As the other members leave, Itachi walks outside in the rain, where Kisame states that it looks like Itachi is crying, and offers his condolences regarding Sasuke's demise. Itachi, however, tells Kisame that Sasuke is still alive.\nSuigetsu, noticing that the snake on a scroll Sasuke had given him has disappeared, uses a drop of Sasuke's blood he has on his person to summon Manda, one of Orochimaru's snakes. Sasuke exits from the snake, revealing that he had summoned Manda and had jumped inside of it to escape Deidara's blast radius, although they both got hit before teleporting away. Manda curses Sasuke with his dying breath for using his Sharingan to control him and use him as a shield. Seeing as Sasuke is injured, Suigetsu, who had been joined by Jūgo and Karin at that time, retreats to a safehouse, where Jūgo tends to Sasuke's wounds. As Suigetsu and Karin get into a fight, Jūgo's murderous impulses begin to manifest, only for Sasuke to use his Sharingan to eradicate the urges. Sasuke instantly passes out from his fatigue, as the other three members decide to stay on Hebi under Sasuke's command.\nMeanwhile, the Eight Man Squad head to the crater, where the ninja hounds have located Sasuke's scent. Kakashi notifies them that one of the scents is that of Deidara of the Akatsuki, whom he had previously thought was dead, and Shino states that Sasuke must have fought him. While the team contemplates whether Sasuke had been eliminated from the blast or if he had escaped, Kiba confirms that it is the latter, as he is still able to track a faint scent with his acute sense of smell; the team then heads off to find Sasuke.\nElsewhere, the leader of the Akatsuki, revealed to be named Pain, along his partner Konan begin discussing plans with a masked man, who is implied to be the real leader of the organisation. The masked man tells Pain and Konan that Sasuke is still alive, and that he would approach them soon; however, he warns them that they must also deal with the Nine-Tails jinchūriki as soon as possible, reminding them that Naruto has learned techniques formidable enough to destroy two of Kakuzu's hearts and that he has powerful allies as well. Konan tells the masked man not to worry as Pain has never lost a fight before. The masked man turns around, revealed to be none other than Tobi, who states that he will have the power of the Sharingan as he is the one and only Madara Uchiha.",

  "description": "Jiraiya arrives in Tsunade's office and tells the Hokage that he has managed to locate Pain, the leader of the Akatsuki. Tsunade decides to mobilise an attack unit until Jiraiya reminds her that they should not be haste, and offers to discuss the situation over a drink. Elsewhere, the Eight Man Squad follow Kiba's sense of smell towards Sasuke, who is sleeping off his injuries. Karin, who was sent to fetch supplies, sense the chakra of both the shinobi and their ninken and warns Sasuke. Sasuke orders Hebi to move out, claiming that the sheer number of forces would indicate that it is a Konoha unit and not the Akatsuki, as the latter move in two-man teams. As Sasuke and Suigetsu head out, Karin asks Jūgo to tie pieces of Sasuke's clothing to birds in order to disperse his scent, making it harder for the ninken to track him.\nOver a bottle of sake, Jiraiya tells Tsunade that Pain lives in Amegakure, an isolated hidden village wedged between the Lands of Earth, Wind and Fire, a place often used as a battleground by the three countries, thus creating numerous refugees. Jiraiya tells Tsunade that due to the isolated nature of the village, many nations do not know that a civil war transpired within Ame and that one half of the village is run by Pain himself. Tsunade worries over Jiraiya going alone, as she deems that Pain must be strong in order to be the leader of formidably powerful individuals that are members of the Akatsuki; Jiraiya, however, reminds her that he is one of the Three Legendary Sannin and that he is more than capable of going alone. Tsunade reminds Jiraiya how their sensei, the Third Hokage, had wanted Jiraiya to succeed him as the Fourth only for Jiraiya to refuse, and how Jiraiya felt despair after being unable to prevent Orochimaru's decline into darkness, hence why he had monitored his old teammate's activities for years. Jiraiya replies spitefully that he does not need to worry about that no more and Tsunade muses on how she never thought Orochimaru would die. Jiraiya recalls the past all three shared, how Tsunade went from a flat-chested girl to a woman with a full bosom, and how they've both grown old despite Tsunade holding all the memories of her loved ones inside of her ample bosom, causing Tsunade to blush.\nIn the woods, Kiba tells the group that Sasuke's scent has dispersed, causing Naruto to use his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique in an attempt to spread out and find Sasuke. He ends up finding Itachi, who tells Naruto that he merely wishes to talk. When Naruto refuses to listen and attempts to attack him, Itachi uses his Demonic Illusion: Mirage Crow to place him within a genjutsu. As the genjutsu fades, Itachi leaves; the rest of the team find Naruto shortly after, who hides his encounter from them.\nMeanwhile, Sasuke manages to reach one of the Akatsuki hideouts that Jūgo had found, telling Hebi to stay outside while he checks it out. Back in Konoha, Jiraiya is prepared to leave when Tsunade tells Jiraiya to summon her if things get bad. Jiraiya reminds Tsunade that she cannot leave the village as she is Hokage, only for Tsunade to retort that Kakashi could succeed her and eventually Naruto as well. Jiraiya laughs at Tsunade's high hopes for Naruto, knowing that her hope comes from the fact that he shares the same dream as her brother and lover and is the only one of the three who did not die. Tsunade retorts that Jiraiya has the very same expectations for Naruto, having taught him the Rasengan. Jiraiya explains that he only did it for nostalgic purposes as Naruto reminds him of his student Minato Namikaze, who became the Fourth Hokage. Tsunade muses how Naruto reminds her of his father Minato due to their looks, but that his personality is more akin to his mother Kushina Uzumaki, a kunoichi from Uzushiogakure. Jiraiya reveals that while he never had children, he thinks of Minato as a son he could be proud of, and Naruto as his grandson by extension.\nJiraiya decides the time for his departure has arrived, and Tsunade tearfully tells him to return back to her safely, as she does not wish to lose him. Jiraiya asks whether she would cry for him and seems as if he was about to confess love for her, only to laugh it off as Tsunade blushes. Due to her bad luck at winning, he tells her to gamble everything on his death so that her bad luck may keep him safe. As he sets off, he reminds her to be wary of Root, which she acknowledges. Jiraiya then leaves the village as Tsunade watches, tears streaming down her face.",

  "description": "During the reign of the Second Hokage, Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru are placed in a squad under Hiruzen Sarutobi, who conducts a bell test with the trio. Tsunade and Orochimaru manage to retrieve both bells while Jiraiya is tied to a stump as punishment for failure. In order to motivate Jiraiya, Hiruzen shows him his Summoning Technique, calling forth Monkey King: Enma. Jiraiya then decides to take his training seriously in order to impress Tsunade, whom he has a crush on, and to be able to use the Summoning Technique himself. After a period of arduous training, Jiraiya attempts to use the Summoning Technique without having signed a blood contract with an animal, and finds himself being transported to Mount Myōboku, home of the toads.\nAt Mount Myōboku, Jiraiya defeats a snake, impressing the young Gamabunta, who was surprised to find a human child. He brings Jiraiya to Fukasaku, one of the Two Great Sage Toads, who tells him that the Great Toad Sage has foretold Jiraiya's arrival and has a prophecy regarding the young shinobi, although he must first remain there and train. Dividing his time between Konoha and Mount Myōboku, Jiraiya manages to vastly improve his skills over the following years. As a young man, he is brought before the Great Toad Sage, who tells Jiraiya that he shall one day have an apprentice — a revolutionary who will either create peace and stability or bring about destruction. He adds that he has also foreseen Jiraiya travelling around the world and writing books, and that it his destiny.\nAs Jiraiya embarks on his quest, journeying around the world in search of his destiny, he comes across five shinobi who would eventually become part of the Six Paths of Pain. His sojourn for his apprentice, however, is cut short when the Third Shinobi World War begins and he is forced to return to Konoha, later witnessing Tsunade mourning the loss of her brother, Nawaki, who was killed in battle. Jiraiya, along with his teammates Orochimaru and Tsunade, join the war where they would later become known as the \"Legendary Sannin\".",

  "description": "Due to the outbreak of the Third Shinobi World War, Team Hiruzen is dispatched to Amegakure, where they survive a battle against the village's leader, Hanzō. As a reward for their strength, Hanzō allows them to live, dubbing them the \"Legendary Sannin\" of Konoha. Following the battle, the Sannin notice that they are being followed by a trio of orphans, consisting of Yahiko, Konan and Nagato. Though Orochimaru suggests killing them to put them out of their misery, Jiraiya decides to stay behind in Ame with the three until they are strong enough to fend for themselves. While working on his novel at their hideout, Konan rushes in to notify Jiraiya that something terrible has happened to Yahiko and Nagato. When Jiraiya arrives, he sees a dead chūnin from Iwagakure, who had been murdered by Nagato after attacking Yahiko. Jiraiya wonders how Nagato managed to kill a chūnin without even knowing ninjutsu and is shocked to see that Nagato wields the Rinnegan, a mythical dōjutsu wielded by the Sage of Six Paths, which is said to have the power to either stabilise the world or annihilate it. Believing that Nagato might be the Child of the Prophecy, Jiraiya trains the three in ninjutsu for the next three years while also writing his first novel.\nAfter Yahiko, Nagato and Konan manage to defeat Jiraiya's shadow clone, he leaves them and returns to Konoha, confident that they are now able to handle themselves. As the war is still raging, the Sannin continue to gain victories in battles against numerous opponents, using their Summoning Technique to call forth Manda, Katsuyu and Gamabunta. After one such battle, Jiraiya is notified by a toad that the three Ame orphans have died, prompting him to reconsider whether the decisions he has made throughout his life were correct. Eventually, the Third Shinobi World War comes to an end due to the actions of another one of Jiraiya's pupils — Minato Namikaze. Sometime after, Minato reads Jiraiya's novel, The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi, and asks Jiraiya for permission to name his unborn son after the protagonist of the story, Naruto, a name which his wife Kushina Uzumaki likes. Jiraiya is named the godfather of the unborn Naruto and sets off on his travels once more, with the narrator proclaiming that it would be some time before Jiraiya would meet Naruto himself.",

  "description": "Using his Hiding in a Toad Technique, Jiraiya manages to successfully infiltrate Amegakure. Pain of the Akatsuki is able to sense through the rain that an intruder has set foot inside their village, and tasks Konan with locating him, the latter forming tiny origami birds, who fly around the village.\nJiraiya stops at a gentleman's club, where he attempts to get close to Tezuna, who reminds him of Tsunade. He attempts to ask her of the whereabouts of Ame's leader, Hanzō, only for Tezuna to tell Jiraiya that Hanzō is not around anymore and that their village is ruled by Lord Pain. Using his Summoning: Toad Shop Technique, Jiraiya lures Tezuna's husband Ryūsui and his partner Yūdachi into what they believe is a bar, which in actuality is the stomach of a toad. Trapped within the amphibian, Jiraiya attempts to extract information from them; when Yūdachi refuses, turns him into a frog.\nThreatening Ryūsui with the same fate, Ryūsui reveals that Hanzō, the previous leader, had been killed by Pain himself. Jiraiya finds this unbelievable, as the three Sannin themselves were unable to defeat Hanzō. Jiraiya adds that Ame is in a civil war, with Hanzō leading one side, but Ryūsui reveals that their civil war ended long ago and that they were ushered into a world of peace by Pain. The holdovers from Hanzō's reign attempted to take their village back, only for Pain to murder all of Hanzō's friends, associates, relatives, and even the infants of those distantly connected to him. Jiraiya then decides to ask Ryūsui about the Akatsuki, but Ryūsui refuses to talk. Inside his tower, Pain opens a hidden doorway, where he puts his present body to sleep so that he may awaken in another.",

  "description": "When Ryūsui refuses to give up knowledge of the Akatsuki, Jiraiya leaves him trapped inside the stomach of a toad while he decides to deal with Pain himself. However, fearing the worst possible outcome, he regurgitates Gerotora, a scroll toad. In the event that he dies, he tells Gerotora to reside with Naruto, which Gerotora refuses to do, since he holds the \"key\" to the Eight Trigrams Seal on Naruto's stomach, and claims that the idea of having a key next a lock is ludicrous. Jiraiya claims that Naruto would need the key someday, while Gerotora reminds Jiraiya that the last time Jiraiya had convinced him to loosen Naruto's seal, Naruto had entered into his four-tailed form and succumbed to the Nine-Tails' influence, nearly killing Jiraiya. Jiraiya retorts that Naruto's father Minato, the Fourth Hokage himself, had sealed the Nine-Tails into Naruto for a reason and entrusted him with the key, in the belief that Naruto would one day be able to control that power. He adds that he believes that the Nine-Tails' attack that happened fifteen years prior was no accident, and that he believes it was manually summoned, like Madara Uchiha once did in the elder days.\nJiraiya proceeds to exit the belly of the frog while masquerading as Ryūsui, unaware that he is being observed by Konan. Konan reports to Pain that the intruder is none other than their old sensei Jiraiya, and Pain tells her that they must kill him regardless, and asks Konan to deal with him until he is able to catch up. Ryūsui is attacked by Konan's Dance of the Shikigami, while Jiraiya reveals himself to be embedded in Ryūsui's shadow. As the real Ryūsui runs away, Jiraiya asks Konan how she became mixed up with the Akatsuki when he had last heard that the three Ame Orphans had died, and asks about the whereabouts of Nagato and Yahiko. After realising that Konan is Ame's \"angel\" and Pain is their \"god\", he deduces that either Nagato or Yahiko is Pain; Konan tells Jiraiya that she will kill him as she has devoted herself to her god Pain and his ideology. As Konan attacks him with her shikigami once more, Jiraiya counters with his Fire Release: Flame Bullet while adding his Toad Oil Bullet right after, coating Konan with oil and rendering her immobile.\nPain himself arrives at that moment, and upon seeing the Rinnegan in his eyes, Jiraiya realises that Pain is in fact Nagato. Summoning his Giant Crustacean, Pain uses its Water Release: Wild Bubble Wave to remove the oil coating Konan, freeing her. Jiraiya binds the beast with his hair along with Pain himself; he demands to know what happened to Yahiko and what Pain's plans are. Pain tells Jiraiya that Yahiko had died, and reveals that his plans are to use the tailed beasts to inflict pain across the world in order to prevent future wars, to force the world to grow up and mature in the way he, Konan and Yahiko did. Escaping from his binds by using his Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon, Pain prepares to kill Jiraiya, as he claims Jiraiya is a mere man while he is a god. Jiraiya counters that he is more than human, as he is the Toad Sage of Mount Myōboku, and proceeds to summon Gamaken, a giant toad.",

  "description": "Jiraiya decides to use Sage Mode in his battle against Pain but needs time to prepare. Clasping his hands together and unable to open them, lest he interrupt his preparation, Jiraiya relies on Gamaken to protect and defend him. Pain uses camouflage to turn himself invisible, while Jiraiya erects a spherical detection barrier to locate him. Pain summons a Giant Multi-Headed Dog. Gamaken is unable to defeat the dogs due to the fact that they are able to multiply when hit; the dogs eventually corner Gamaken and bite into him, wounding him severely. Jiraiya uses his Summoning: Crushing Toad Stomach to reverse summon himself, Gamaken and the dogs into the stomach of a toad, where the toad walls begin to absorb the dogs, which dispel themselves.\nPain states that the battle is over as Jiraiya had escaped, only for Jiraiya and Gamaken to have located the camouflaged Pain. Gamaken is able to strike at Pain's Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon, although Pain summons a Giant Drill-Beaked Bird to dive bomb itself towards Jiraiya and Gamaken as retribution. Jiraiya begins to run away, his hands still clasped, while being chased by the bird. However, after tricking the bird into coming face-to-face with him, Jiraiya incinerates the bird with his Fire Release: Flame Bullet. After utilising shadow clones to aid him against Pain's Giant Ox and Giant Rhino, Jiraiya is finally able to call upon Fukasaku and Shima, the Two Great Sage Toads of Mount Myōboku. He tells them that he has summoned them due to the fact that his enemy possesses the Rinnegan, the mythical dojutsu once wielded by the Sage of Six Paths. To make matters worse, he believes Pain is the Child of the Prophecy, one who the Great Toad Sage prophecised would bring either peace or destruction upon the world. As Pain fits into the latter category, Jiraiya and the toads realise that it is Jiraiya's duty to kill Pain, who summons his other Paths.",

  "description": "Pain summons two more bodies — the Preta Path and the Human Path. Jiraiya is shocked beyond his wits to see three Rinnegan wielders before him; Pain decides to take advantage of the situation by having his Human Path rush towards Jiraiya, only for Jiraiya to give him a roundhouse kick in the face and blind him. Fukasaku uses a smoke bomb while Jiraiya unleashes his senjutsu-influenced Hair Needle Senbon, which Pain is able to block by summoning a Giant Panda. Jiraiya attempts to destroy the three Paths using his Sage Art: Goemon, a cooperation ninjutsu used alongside the Two Great Sage Toads, only for the Paths to be unscathed. Amazed at how they were able to escape its effects, Jiraiya tries to destroy the Preta Path with an Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan; however, the Path proceeds to absorb the technique and render it useless.\nJiraiya, Fukasaku and Shima decide to escape through the pipes, wondering how to defeat three Rinnegan wielders as neither ninjutsu or taijutsu would work on them. Since Jiraiya does not use genjutsu, a fact that Pain is aware of, Jiraiya asks the two toads to use their genjutsu, which he would not be expecting, while he tries out a gamble of his. Since Fukasaku was able to deduce that the three Paths shared the same vision through their Rinnegan eyes, Jiraiya has the toads lure them with their genjutsu, which involves croaking frog sounds that reveal their location to Pain. As the three Paths rush towards them, Jiraiya hits one of them with his Fire Release: Big Flame Bullet. After the Path absorbs it, Jiraiya's theory is confirmed — each of the Paths only possesses one ability, hence why the earlier Animal Path had only summoned creatures to fight Jiraiya instead of using actual jutsu. The three Paths are struck by the toads' Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant, and Jiraiya proceeds to use three stone swords to impale them.\nAs he walks away, believing he has killed them, he is struck from behind by another Path, who manages to destroy Jiraiya's left arm. Pain then brings forth five other bodies, including the three that Jiraiya had just impaled. He reveals that Pain is just an alias, meant to refer to the Six Paths of Pain, while Jiraiya seems to recognise one of the Paths.",

  "description": "Jiraiya notices that one of the Paths looks just like Yahiko, and wonders if Pain is Yahiko or Nagato and why there are six Rinnegan wielders; Pain, however, merely states that they are the Six Paths of Pain and attempt to finish off Jiraiya. Using his Barrier: Toad Gourd Prison technique, Jiraiya is able to trap the Animal Path and strike it with his Rasengan, knocking it into gastric acid. Before the Path dies, it manages to stab Jiraiya through the arm and chest. As the Path's forehead protector falls off, Jiraiya notices a scar and realises it is a man he fought once before. Wanting to discover more about Pain, Jiraiya attempts to dismiss the Two Great Sage Toads, telling them to take the Animal Path's corpse to Tsunade. Not wanting to leave him alone, Shima agrees to do it alone while Fukasaku stays with Jiraiya.\nAs Jiraiya reaches the surface, he takes a good look at all of the Paths' faces and recognises that he has met every single one of them before. He deduces Pain's identity, but before he can tell Fukasaku, one of the Paths crushes his throat and the six Paths proceed to impale him through the back. With his throat crushed and his heart beginning to fail, Jiraiya comes to the realisation that he is dying. He recalls his life, including being rejected by Tsunade, and how is not dying a glorious death like the Third and Fourth Hokages. In his last moments, he reminisces fondly on memories of Minato and his wife Kushina and how they had asked Jiraiya to be Naruto's godfather and if they could name Naruto after the protagonist of Jiraiya's novel as Minato liked the character, who never gave up. Remembering that Naruto never gave up as it was his ninja way, Jiraiya states that as his master, he cannot give up either. Managing to stay alive with his sheer force of will, Jiraiya uses his Finger Carving Seal to write a coded message about Pain's true identity on Fukasaku's back. The Six Paths of Pain attack the duo, but Fukasaku escapes as Jiraiya drowns. As he passes away, he remarks that Naruto is the true Child of the Prophecy and how the sequel to his novel would be titled \"The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki\".\nIn Konoha, Tsunade sits on a ledge watching a river, noticing a frog. Naruto, who is running through the woods, suddenly stops when he feels Jiraiya's arm on his shoulder, unaware that a light is shining on him from up above.",

Sasuke uses his speed to come behind Itachi and impales his brother with his Chidori Sharp Spear.

As the clone is dispelled, its memories are absorbed by the original Naruto, who tells the team that he has found Sasuke's location. However, as they rush to find Sasuke, they find themselves blocked by Tobi. Kakashi muses that Tobi was not in the Akatsuki roster Kabuto had provided and Tobi explains that he is a new member. Under Yamato's formation, Naruto, Sakura, Kiba and Akamaru try to attack Tobi, who easily dodges their moves, and even manages to elude Naruto's Rasengan. Using his Whac-A-Mole Technique, Tobi manages to strike every single member of the team whilst simultaneously avoiding being struck himself.\nMeanwhile, Sasuke's team reaches the Uchiha hideout, where they are greeted by Kisame Hoshigaki. Kisame tells them as per Itachi's orders, only Sasuke may be permitted to enter. Sasuke tells the group to stay put as he ventures into the hideout, ready to finish Itachi off once and for all. Outside the hideout, Suigetsu decides to challenge Kisame as the latter is one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist who possesses the Samehada blade. In order to make use of their waiting time, Suigetsu and Kisame engage in combat.",

  "description": "As Sasuke approaches the Uchiha Hideout, Itachi sits on a chair waiting for him, reminiscing on the last days of his clan. After carrying Sasuke home as he had sprained his ankle, Itachi was told by his father Fugaku to attend an Uchiha clan meeting the next day, which Itachi chose not to attend due to his Anbu priorities. The following day, he was approached by Uchiha clan members of the Konoha Military Police Force, who believed he was responsible for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, who had also missed the meeting. Itachi fought the police officers, calling the Uchiha clan arrogant and pathetic, relenting only after hearing Sasuke's voice. Shortly after, as his mother made him dinner, Itachi had slaughtered the entire clan, sparing only Sasuke's life. As Sasuke had demanded why Itachi would do such a thing, Itachi had told him that he has butchered them all simply to test the limit of his power, and wanted Sasuke to grow powerful so that he may be a worthy opponent for him one day. Before he departed, Itachi reveals to Sasuke that the secret behind the Mangekyō Sharingan is to kill your best friend, explaining that he did kill Shisui, and if Sasuke followed in his steps, he would be the third one in the clan to have activated the Mangekyō.\nItachi is awoken from his reverie as Sasuke enters the hideout. Itachi asks what Sasuke sees with his Sharingan, to which Sasuke replies that he sees Itachi dead. The two begin fighting as Sasuke attempts to strike with his Chidori Sharp Spear; Itachi uses his Early Sacrifice technique to jump on Sasuke's shoulder, evading the attack, and spins Sasuke around before slamming him into a wall. As Sasuke hits the wall, he prepares his Chidori and rushes towards Itachi. Just as Itachi expects Sasuke to thrust him with it, Sasuke disperses the lighning chakra through his Chidori Current, and uses the opportunity to leap into the air and impales Itachi with his sword.\nAs Itachi falls on the ground below, he muses that Sasuke has grown strong and disintegrates into a flock of crows. Sasuke realises that Itachi has been using a genjutsu, but it turns out that the Sasuke that was fighting is also an illusion; the real Sasuke sneaks up from behind Itachi and runs his sword through him. As Itachi coughs up blood, Sasuke demands to know who else from the Uchiha clan survived. When Itachi further questions his demand, Sasuke reminds him that he was told he would be the third to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan, meaning there was someone else out there other than Itachi who possessed it. Believing that this person aided Itachi take out the police force in the clan's massacre, Sasuke pushes the blade further through Itachi's torso as he demands to know who it is so that he may kill that person as well. Itachi responds that it is none other than Madara Uchiha, the co-founder of Konohagakure; Sasuke recalls the Nine-Tailed Fox telling him that he reminded the tailed beast of Madara from the elder days.",

  "description": "Sasuke finds Itachi's claim of Madara Uchiha being a co-conspirator of the Uchiha Clan Downfall to be a farce, since Madara was the co-founder of Konohagakure and thus should be long dead. Itachi reminds Sasuke that one's reality is merely another's fantasy and that the truth is that Madara is still alive, whether he would like to believe it or not. As Sasuke has his sword impaled through Itachi's back, he tells Itachi that his Sharingan has matured to a point where Itachi's genjutsu won't work on him; Sasuke then turns around and fires a Chidori Sharp Spear at the real Itachi, who is sitting behind him, missing Itachi's face by inches. The brothers are unaware that their bout is being witnessed by Zetsu, who wonders why they haven't begun their clash already.\nItachi tells Sasuke that he would like to take the time to share a little history regarding the Uchiha clan and pulls Sasuke into a genjutsu, where Sasuke sees Madara and his younger brother Izuna sparring. Itachi explains that the two brothers always fought one another to push each to their limits and eventually killed their own comrades to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan. With the Mangekyō granting him visual prowess, Madara became the head of the clan and waged war against numerous villages; however, the Mangekyō had a price for those who used its abilities, and Madara was rendered blind. Desperate to regain his vision once more, Madara stole his brother Izuna's eyes and fused them with his own, creating an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan that heightens the user's visual prowess and does not cause them to lose their vision.\nEventually, Madara formed an alliance with Hashirama Senju of the Senju clan, who would become the First Hokage, and fought for leadership at the Valley of the End. In a bid to gain vengeance, Itachi reveals that it was Madara who unleashed the Nine-Tailed Fox on Konoha 16 years ago, as he was able to control the tailed beast with his Eternal Mangekyō. Itachi tells Sasuke that since the Eternal Mangekyō can only be activated by taking the Sharingan eyes of a close family member, ideally a sibling, he plans to take Sasuke's eyes and reach a status higher than Madara himself ever obtained.\nRealising that his life's goal is finally in front of him, Sasuke removes his bandages as he launches a volley of shuriken at Itachi, who fires his own back. Sasuke rushes towards Itachi with his sword, who blocks it. As they remain locked in each other's grip, Itachi's shadow clone comes from above, throwing kunai towards Sasuke. Forcing a snake to burst out of his cursed seal, Sasuke uses the snake to shield himself and leap backwards. Using the Unsealing Technique, Sasuke summons a fūma shuriken and hurls it at Itachi, who blocks it with a kunai. However, Sasuke managed to imbue the fūma shuriken with his Lightning Release, running his Chidori through it; the process destroys the Itachi shadow clone.\nUsing his Mangekyō, Itachi arrives before Sasuke and kicks him into a wall, trapping his arms and feet. He asks Sasuke to forgive him as he seemingly removes Sasuke's Sharingan eyes.",

  "description": "Itachi manages to extract Sasuke's right Sharingan eye and attempts to remove his left eye as well, only for Sasuke to enter into the second stage of his cursed seal, using his only remaining wing to push Itachi away. Itachi, though, uses a shadow clone to bind Sasuke from behind while he approaches his brother and attempts to pull his left eye out. The entire ordeal, however, is revealed to be Tsukuyomi, a Mangekyō Sharingan genjutsu that Sasuke is able to break through, much to the shock and surprise of Itachi and Zetsu, who is discreetly observing the battle.\nWhite Zetsu wonders how Sasuke was able to break out of it with his regular Sharingan, since the Mangekyō Sharingan is touted to be stronger, and Black Zetsu claims that Sasuke's proficiency with his Sharingan exceeds Itachi's, likening it to a pebble being thrown a master taking out a shuriken thrown by a rookie. As Itachi is on his knees, reeling from the pain in his eyes, Sasuke unseals and summons two fūma shuriken, which he hurls at Itachi, hiding the second shuriken in the shadow of the first. Itachi barely manages to avoid being sliced by the two shuriken when Sasuke pulls the shuriken with wire strings, stabbing Itachi. Zetsu wonders how Itachi could have gotten hit as he should be able to dodge such an attack; Itachi is revealed to be suffering from blurry vision after having used his Tsukuyomi. Upon seeing his dazed brother, Sasuke mocks his visual prowess before using his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique at Itachi. Itachi is barely able to evade it, leaping into the air, only for Sasuke to rush towards him with his Chidori in hand.\nSasuke's Chidori manages to hit the ceiling, creating a massive hole; Itachi uses the Great Fireball Technique both offensively and defensively, propelling himself out of the Chidori's range. As they both land on the rooftop, they both use the Great Fireball Technique, their flames clashing against one another. Itachi unleashes the Amaterasu ability from his right Mangekyō Sharingan to create inextinguishable black flames that smother Sasuke's orange flames and proceeds to burn Sasuke himself. Sasuke attempts to shield himself with his wing, only for the wing to burn off. As the Amaterasu attempts to consume him in flames, Sasuke reverts back to his normal state and uses his Chidori Sharp Spear to create a hole beneath him while shedding his skin to avoid being burned by Itachi's Amaterasu, having gained the ability to do so after absorbing Orochimaru.\nReactivating his cursed seal to its second stage once more, Sasuke uses the last of his chakra to use Fire Release: Great Dragon Fire Technique, creating a dragon-head shaped fireball that bursts through the roof, narrowly missing Itachi and firing off into the clouds. As Sasuke's cursed seal recedes once more, Itachi, using his Sharingan to gauge Sasuke's chakra levels, claims that Sasuke has lost the battle. Sasuke, however, gives Itachi a smirk and asks if he would actually come to a death match unprepared, as storm clouds begin to rumble above them. Sasuke warns Itachi that his next technique is unavoidable, just like the Amaterasu.",

  "description": "As the thunder clouds begin to form above them, Zetsu realises that Sasuke had created them from the heat of his Fire Release: Great Dragon Fire Technique along with the heat of Itachi's inextinguishable Amaterasu. Harnessing the lightning in the clouds with his chakra, Sasuke uses his new jutsu, Kirin, in an attempt to kill Itachi and ends up completely obliterating the Uchiha Hideout.\nSasuke believes he has finally won, only for Itachi to stand up, having survived Kirin's impact due to his Susanoo, a colossal chakra guardian exclusive to those who possess the Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes. As Itachi begins to make his way towards Sasuke, who is out of chakra, the repressed portion of Orochimaru that Sasuke had absorbed begins to take over his body. Using the Eight Branches Technique, Orochimaru's eight white snakes burst out of Sasuke's cursed seal as Orochimaru himself exits from one of the snake's mouths, thanking Itachi for lowering Sasuke's chakra enough to the point where he could break free and grateful that he has another opportunity to take over Sasuke's body.\nUsing his Susanoo's Sword of Totsuka, which has the ability to seal any soul and trap it forever in a genjutsu, Itachi decapitates seven of the eight snakes and manages to seal Orochimaru away, removing Sasuke's cursed seal in the process. However, this takes too much chakra, and Itachi's Susanoo is reduced to its most basic form. Itachi, coughing up blood, slowly makes his way towards Sasuke, who is unable to move away from him. As Itachi comes close to Sasuke, he whispers his last words to Sasuke and proceeds to poke his forehead before collapsing down to the floor, dead. Sasuke contemplates Itachi's last words and stares at his brother's corpse before collapsing next to him out of sheer exhaustion.",

  "description": "In the woods, the Eight Man Squad find themselves unable to defeat Akatsuki member Tobi. Despite Naruto managing to hit him with a Rasengan, Yamato binding him with his Wood Release and Shino using his Secret Technique: Insect Sphere, all of those attacks manage to go through Tobi. Kakashi is forced to uncover his Sharingan, but does not go head to head with Tobi as Zetsu arrives, announcing to everyone that Sasuke has managed to kill Itachi Uchiha, shocking the group. Tobi immediately drops his high-pitched voice and goofy demeanour and reverts to a cold, harsh tone, telling the group that he will see them later. He and Zetsu then head to the Uchiha Hideout in order to retrieve Sasuke and Itachi's bodies; however, before he leaves, he stares at Kakashi, and Kakashi notices in shock that Tobi possesses the Sharingan as well.\nAt the hideout ruins, Tobi asks Zetsu if he had recorded the event, as he wishes to analyse it later. Taking the bodies of the Uchihas, they flee to their hideout. Zetsu also stops the fight between Kisame and Suigetsu, notifying them of Sasuke's victory and inviting Hebi to the Akatsuki's hideout in the East. Kisame, however, chooses to resign from the Akatsuki following Itachi's demise. Meanwhile, using Hinata's Byakugan, the Eight Man Squad reach the hideout, only to find themselves blocked by Itachi's Amaterasu; Yamato uses his Earth Release: Earth Flow Divide to provide them a safe passage. As they stand on the ruins of the hideout, they realise that Sasuke is gone, while Naruto cries about how he is never able to catch up to Sasuke.\nAt their hideout, Tobi reveals to Sasuke that he is a survivor of the Uchiha Clan Downfall and partially removes his mask in order to show Sasuke his Sharingan. However, Sasuke's left Sharingan immediately activates and transforms into Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan, igniting Tobi with Amaterasu. Fleeing and returning moments later, Tobi explains that Itachi must have passed down the Amaterasu to Sasuke and have it rigged to go off if he made eye contact with his Sharingan. Sasuke wonders why Itachi would have done such a thing, and Tobi replies that he knows many things about Itachi that Sasuke does not, including the fact that Itachi was trying to protect Sasuke.",

  "description": "Sasuke finds it hard to believe that Itachi was protecting him, telling Tobi that Itachi was the one who murdered their clan. Tobi tells Sasuke that Itachi did not cause the massacre single-handedly, revealing that he helped and that he is none other than Madara Uchiha. He asks Sasuke to remember the memories of his brother when he was younger, causing Sasuke to remember talking to Itachi when they were younger as to why the crest of the Konoha Military Police Force bore the insignia of their clan. Unable to process the information, Sasuke lashes out at Madara and passes out soon after.\nAs he wakes up, Sasuke finds himself bound. Madara tells Sasuke that Itachi's fate is linked to the events of the Warring States Period as Itachi's decision to murder their clan was in actuality a mission given to him by the higher-ups in Konoha, and that it is a tale that he believes Sasuke should know; he adds that Itachi had passed down his Amaterasu to prevent Sasuke from hearing the story. Sasuke agrees to listen, and Madara begins his tale. Back during the era of the Warring States, where many villages attacked one another in an attempt to increase their borders or military strength, two clans stood out as the most powerful clans — the Uchiha clan and the Senju Clan. The Senju clan was led by Hashirama Senju, whom Madara had fought many times. One day, after a long time of fighting, both the Uchiha clan and the Senju came to a peace treaty, with only Madara being against it. However, as leader of the clan, Madara went along with the clan's wishes and together they formed Konohagakure.\nHowever, when it came time to choose the Hokage who would rule the village, Hashirama was chosen, leaving Madara incensed that he was not. He attempted to convince the Uchiha clan to protest the Senju government, but was shunned by his own clan for wanting to start another conflict; to make matters worse, the clan believed that he had killed his own younger brother and had stolen his Mangekyō Sharingan, with Madara revealing to Sasuke that his brother had given them willingly. In an attempt to get revenge on the village, Madara fought with Hashirama using the Nine-Tailed Fox at what would later become known as the Valley of the End. Many shinobi, Hashirama included, believed Madara had died during that final conflict.\nOver time, Hashirama's younger brother Tobirama Senju was chosen to be the Second Hokage, and as an act of \"trust\" towards the Uchiha clan, he had delegated all of them to the police force, thus barring them from high-ranking positions within the Senju government. Some of the Uchiha clansmen began to inherit Madara's will and ideology and did not like the idea of being the Senju's lackeys. Nonetheless, the Uchiha clan did nothing about it until sixteen years prior, when the Nine-Tails attacked Konoha. Since the Sharingan is able to control the tailed beast, the government had placed the Uchiha clan under suspicion of the attack and had forced them to relocate on the outskirts of the village. Thus, the Uchiha clan began to plan a coup d'état in order to overthrow the Senju government. Madara reveals that except for the Third Hokage, the other members of the government approved the decision to keep the Uchiha clan under observation. He reveals Itachi was an Anbu tasked with spying on the Uchiha clan who was eventually ordered to exterminate them, and that the only people who knew the truth were Koharu Utatane and Homura Mitokado (the two advisors of the Konoha Council), Danzō Shimura of the Anbu and the Third Hokage himself.",

  "description": "Madara Uchiha continues to tell Sasuke about the truth behind Itachi's actions. When Itachi was four, he had witnessed the deaths of many during the Third Shinobi World War, and thus developed a pacifist nature. Sasuke and Itachi's father, Fugaku, was the mastermind behind the coup d'état that would have had the Uchiha clan overthrow the Senju government.\nIn order to aid in his coup, Fugaku had Itachi placed within the Anbu so he would serve as a spy for them. However, Itachi's loyalty was not towards his clan, but towards the village, and wanted to do what was best for Konohagakure. Thus, the Konoha Council and Danzō Shimura had exploited that trait and had Itachi spy on the Uchiha clan for them. When the Third Hokage was unable to come to a peaceful negotiation with the Uchiha clan, the elders decided to eliminate them. Itachi was tasked with a hard decision — allow his clan to carry out its coup, causing the destabilisation of their village, deaths of countless innocent people as well as incite neighbouring nations to invade them, potentially starting the Fourth Shinobi World War, or to exterminate his clan in order to prevent a war and the numerous casualties that would come with it.\nMadara tells Sasuke that around that time, he had infiltrated Konoha in order to have his vengeance on the village itself as well as the Uchiha clan who had shunned him. Itachi was the only person who had known he was still alive and had managed to locate him, and had proceeded to offer him a counter proposal — he would help Madara extinguish the Uchiha clan in exchange for sparing the village, which Madara had readily agreed to. However, while Itachi had managed to murder his father, his mother, and his lover, he was unable to kill his little brother, and thus had spared Sasuke's life. Following the clan's massacre, Madara and Itachi had split their ways while Itachi, reporting the mission's success to the village, had left Konoha; however, he had asked the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe from harm and threatened to leak the village's intelligence to unallied nations otherwise.\nSasuke refuses to accept Madara's story, claiming that Itachi had murdered their clan to test the limits of his abilities, that he was nothing more than a criminal who joined the Akatsuki, and that Itachi had no reason to protect him, citing that Itachi would not have used his Mangekyō Sharingan against him if he was not trying to kill him. Madara reveals to Sasuke that Itachi's goal, other than implanting the Amaterasu within Sasuke, was to seal away Orochimaru as well as Sasuke's Cursed Seal of Heaven, a feat that was only capable if he had reduced Sasuke's chakra levels to their bare minimum. Madara also divulges that following the Konoha Crush, Itachi's true motive for returning to the village was to make sure that Sasuke would be kept safe from the likes of Danzō following the Third's death, and that he was also spying on the Akatsuki from within for Konoha's sake.\nAs Madara finishes his tale, Sasuke stands on a cliff, noticing at a hawk flying around. Tears streaming down his face, he recalls the memories of his brother he had before the clan's massacre and how much he had loved and respected Itachi. He then declares that he is renaming their team from Hebi to Taka, and that their new mission is to destroy Konohagakure, awakening his own Mangekyō Sharingan in the process.",

  "description": "As the Eight Man Squad stand on the ruins of the Uchiha Hideout, Kakashi orders them all to fan out and track Sasuke's lingering scent. However, the scent is too faint and, unable to locate Sasuke and their mission to find Itachi being a failure, Kakashi decides that they should all return back to Konoha.\nElsewhere, Tobi finds Sasuke staring up at a full moon, the latter claiming that every time he does so, he is reminded of that fateful night. Sasuke tells him that he is able to access repressed memories of that night, including awakening his Sharingan for the first time and chasing after Itachi, who looked back at him as tears fell down his face. Sasuke had believed that he had imagined it, but the memory of the tears convinces him that the story he heard was true. Meanwhile, Tobi manages to locate Kisame, who had decided to leave the Akatsuki following Itachi's death. Tobi, however, changes from his goofy voice and demeanour to a more serious one and removes his mask, and Kisame recognises him as Madara Uchiha, the former Mizukage himself. Surprised that Tobi is actually Madara and that Madara is pulling the strings, Kisame decides to rejoin the Akatsuki.\nIn their hideout, Tobi asks Sasuke what his intentions are, and Sasuke responds that he plans to kill the elders of Konoha to avenge Itachi and their clan but does not care what happens to the villagers. Tobi then proposes to Sasuke and his team that they work together to find the tailed beasts in order to achieve their goals. Madara explains that there are nine of them, whom the First Hokage used to control and use to settle conflicts. As a sign of the nations' alliance, the First Hokage had given a tailed beast to every nation. Madara asks Taka to join the Akatsuki since they are low on manpower, following the recent deaths of their many members, and tasks Taka with capturing the Eight-Tails while the Akatsuki capture Naruto, the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails.\nOutside, Madara has a conversation with Zetsu and expressed his gratitude that Itachi is dead, since without him around to stop them, they may finally invade and destroy Konoha. Zetsu inquires as to why Itachi would have passed down his Amaterasu to Sasuke if he did not know that Madara knew the truth, to which Madara responds that it was most likely to prevent Sasuke's induction into the ranks of the Akatsuki. Madara claims that with Itachi gone and Sasuke taking his place, his plans are finally coming to fruition.\nOn their sojourn to find the Eight-Tails, Sasuke uses his Mangekyō Sharingan's genjutsu to interrogate Kiyoi Yotsuki, a shinobi from Kumogakure, who reveals that the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki is a man with a tattoo on his right shoulder and numerous blades in his possession, and that he is at the Valley of Clouds and Lightning. After arriving at the valley, they find themselves face-to-face with a rapper named Killer B, who is the jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails. Suigetsu attempts to attack him with his Kubikiribōchō, only for Killer B to use his strength to pry the blade away from him; Jūgo attempts to attack as well, but Killer B uses the Kubikiribōchō to defeat him. Seeing his defeated teammates, Sasuke decides to step up and handle the jinchūriki himself, claiming that he wishes to acquire the tailed beast in order to use the Akatsuki in his quest to destroy Konoha.",

  "description": "With his Sword of Kusanagi in hand, Sasuke goes up against Killer B, the jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails. Killer B, in possession of Suigetsu's Kubikiribōchō, attempts to strike at Sasuke, only for the latter to pin his sword into the ground to balance himself as he kicks Killer B in the neck. Sasuke manages to loosen Killer B's grip on the Kubikiribōchō and returns it to Suigetsu.\nWith the Kubikiribōchō being taken away from him, Killer B unleashes his seven swords and wields them using various parts of his body. Sasuke attempts to hit Killer B with his Sword of Kusanagi: Chidori Katana, only for Killer B to infuse his own Lightning Release into his swords, blocking the attack. Sasuke continues to go on the offensive, using his Sharingan to keep track of the swords, but nearly misses Killer B attempting a heel kick; Sasuke avoids the kick but ends up being severely impaled by two of his swords.\nKarin tells Sasuke to bite her, her chakra healing Sasuke's near-fatal wounds, as Killer B attempts to take the opportunity to kill Sasuke; however, Suigetsu blocks the attack with his Kubikiribōchō. Killer B's Lightning Release swords begin to slice through Suigetsu's blade, but Sasuke recovers enough to use his Chidori to counter Killer B's chakra. As Karin sits out, exhausted from healing Sasuke, the others decide to attack Killer B in tandem, with Suigetsu advising that they not hold back. Killer B manages to use his Disturbance Taijutsu to land a hit on Suigetsu, grinding his fist into the other's chest, only for Suigetsu to trap Killer B's fist with his Hydrification Technique. With Killer B unable to move out of the way, Suigetsu tells Sasuke to hit them both, and Sasuke uses his Chidori on Killer B as he is wet, the water conducting the electricity and shocking both of them.\nAs Killer B lays there dazed, Jūgo attempts to hit him from above, only for Killer B to jump out of the way. The jinchūriki states that he has had enough with the battle and decides to go out for a drink. Using her Mind's Eye of the Kagura technique, Karin spots Killer B's location as Sasuke rushes towards him. Realising that his foes are troublesome, Killer B goes into his Version 1 form, growing chakra tails; Sasuke recalls when Naruto did the same during their battle. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke is able to dodge Killer B's tailed form, only for the jinchūriki to go after the other Taka members. Entering into a partial transformation, Jūgo uses his jet boosters to save himself, Karin, and Suigetsu, though the latter falls into the surrounding body of water.\nThe result of Killer B slamming into the ground causes large clouds of smoke to appear before them. Killer B attempts to rush at Sasuke, who uses his Mangekyo enhanced genjutsu on him. However, Killer B snaps out of the genjutsu instantly and uses his Lightning Release: Lariat to punch Sasuke, rupturing his neck, chest, and his organs. Killer B muses how genjutsu does not work jinchūriki who have complete control of their tailed beast since the beast's chakra could snap the host out of any genjutsu.\nAs Sasuke lays there dying, Jūgo uses his Piston Fist: Style One to punch the jinchūriki and proceeds to use his Cellular Regeneration Ejection to heal Sasuke, claiming that Sasuke would not die from it since he is compatible with the cursed seal; however, the process causes Jūgo to regress in physical age, giving him the appearance of a young child. Meanwhile, Killer B enters into a full transformation, unleashing the Eight-Tailed Ox from within. As he attempts to attacks them, Suigetsu uses the surrounding water to create a form that resembles a demon-like fish, and blocks Killer B's attack. In this form, Suigetsu is able to face the Eight-Tails head on while Sasuke, Karin and Jūgo try to flee. In order to prevent their escape, Killer B fires his Tailed Beast Ball at them, although Suigetsu's form is able to absorb all the damage himself, saving his teammates.\nShocked at the fact that Suigetsu was willing to risk his life for him and recalling how Karin and Jūgo had healed him from fatal injuries at their own expense, Sasuke is reminded of Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura. Wanting to protect his teammates, Sasuke's left Sharingan transforms into the Mangekyō and proceeds to use Amaterasu, setting the tailed beast on fire. Killer B attempts to use a tentacle to crush Karin but Sasuke uses his Chidori Sharp Spear to slice the tentacle off; however, another tentacles manages to swat Karin and she is engulfed in the black flames as well. Desperate to save Karin's life, Sasuke's left Mangekyō manages to extinguish the flames, much to his surprise. Realising he can control the flames, Sasuke puts out the Amaterasu, revealing an unconscious Killer B.\nWith his eyes bleeding from using the Mangekyō, Sasuke asks Jūgo to retrieve Karin as well as Killer B. Unbeknownst to them, they are being observed by J and K, two shinobi of Kumogakure. Noticing the Akatsuki robes as well as Sasuke's Uchiha clan crest, and remembering how Yugito Nii, another jinchūriki from their village, was killed by the Akatsuki, the two shinobi decide to report their findings to the Raikage, who happens to be Killer B's brother.\nJūgo and Sasuke begin their walk back to their hideout, carrying an unconscious Karin and Killer B, as well as Suigetsu, who has been rendered to a jelly-like state. Jūgo asks if Sasuke is okay physically, as he had lost his Cursed Seal of Heaven in his fight with Itachi and subsequently did not recover completely from said fight. Sasuke admits that he did not expect a fight of such magnitude, but states that at least they managed to succeed in their mission.",

  "description": "On a cliff, a young lady named Hotaru sits on the edge overlooking the mountain when she is approached by a young man named Utakata. Hotaru's servant, Tonbee, tells them that there are enemies out there triggering their traps and are most likely invading Mount Katsuragi in order to get their heads on Hotaru's grandfather's forbidden technique. Tonbee decides to protect the fort as Utakata and Hotaru escape. Tonbee, however, manages to send word out to Konohagakure for help.\nIn her office, Tsunade is given the request by Shizune, and the former explains that long ago, En no Gyōja, the leader of the Tsuchigumo Clan, had developed a technique that was capable of destroying an entire village. The Third Hokage had then requested that En no Gyōja classify it as a kinjutsu; in return, Konoha would provide them with assistance whenever they would need it. In order to protect Naruto from the Akatsuki, Tsunade decides to send Naruto amongst the squad that is to be dispatched to Mount Katsuragi.\nAfter having failed to complete the Itachi Pursuit Mission, the Eight Man Squad make their way back home when they are stopped by Katsuyu, the personal summon of Tsunade herself. Katsuyu relays the situation at Mount Katsuragi to Kakashi, who decides to send Team 7, under Yamato's command, to deal with the crisis. Meanwhile, the four bandits manage to shatter the barrier and infiltrate the fort, only to find Tonbee and no forbidden scroll. They attack the old man, who does not divulge any information. Of one of the bandits, Akaboshi, manages to deduce that En no Gyōja's granddaughter must possess the scroll with the kinjutsu and decides that they should leave, as he senses Team 7's impending arrival.\nAs they get there, Sai finds the hidden path that Hotaru and Utakata had used to escape. Yamato orders Sakura to stay with Tonbee and heal him while the other three follow the hidden path. On the path, Hotaru asks Utakata to teach her more techniques, with Utakata stating that he has taught her nothing. She asks whether he remembers the first time he met and he had saved her life, using his Soap Bubble Ninjutsu to kill enemy shinobi who were after her. Utakata reveals that they were after him, as he is a wanted man, and that he was only saving himself; his only reason for coming with her to their fort was to throw off his trail. Hotaru does not care, and cries for her \"master\" to train her. Angered at being called master, Utakata lashes out, only for Naruto to interfere. Using his shadow clones, Naruto attempts to defeat Utakata, who uses his Drowning Bubble Technique to take out the shadow clones. However, Hotaru tells Naruto that Utakata is her protector, not her enemy.\nAs Yamato and Sai catch up, Naruto apologises for attacking him. Utakata, however, tells him that he is leaving Hotaru under Team 7's care and begins to walk away. Hotaru runs up to her, pleading for him to stay, but he merely creates a bubble and drifts away.",

  "description": "The four bandits have a meeting with their leader, who tells them that En no Gyōja's secret technique unleashed its true potential during the Third Shinobi World War and that if they acquired it, they could use it become rulers of various lands. However, he advises them not to engage in combat with the Konoha shinobi team dispatched to provide assistance, claiming that once they reached the Tsuchigumo Clan's village, they would depart, allowing the bandits to swoop in and retrieve the kinjutsu.\nElsewhere, Utakata sits against a tree, blowing bubbles. He remembers when he first met Hotaru, and how she begged him to be her master. Having been irritated at the word \"master\" (due to his own master abusing him), he refused; Hotaru, however, reminded him that he was getting free food and a room and that he should pay them back by teaching her. He told her that he would consider it if she is able to walk on water. When Hotaru failed, Utakata claimed that he cannot teach anyone ninjutsu if they cannot manage to walk on the surface of water. Nevertheless, Hotaru practised all night and come morning, she mastered the technique. Wanting to get her off his back, Utakata showed her the Water Release: Wild Water Wave technique, and told her to master that before being his student. As she failed to perform the technique, Utakata smiled as he mused that only one who possesses Water Release could use the jutsu. Yet, by the next morning, Hotaru managed to master the Wild Water Wave technique as well.\nUtakata is snapped out of his reverie when he notices four shadows flitting through the trees. He attacks them with his bubbles, claiming that he was from Mount Katsuragi, the fort they had attacked, and that he is interested in getting his hands on the forbidden technique as well. He uses his bubble clones to deceive them while also blinding one of them, although he is caught in the middle of an exploding barrier.\nMeanwhile, Hotaru attempts to brush off Naruto, who is following her through the woods. She tells him to leave, as she can handle herself. Yamato gives Sai an idea, and Sai creates an ink leech that falls on Hotaru. Panicking, she cries out for Naruto to help her, and asks him to come with her until the forest clears out, being afraid of leeches. As they walk, with Naruto constantly swatting away the leeches, Hotaru talks about how she had viewed Utakata as his master. Naruto tells her about his own master, who is a pervert, but states that Jiraiya is strong and kind-hearted and that he would not mind becoming like him some day. The team eventually reaches the village, where they leave Hotaru at the hands of the Tsuchigumo Chief, who is Hotaru's uncle. Naruto notices all the villagers glaring at her, but leaves along with Yamato and Sai. However, he finds himself riddles with uncertainty and rushes back to the village alone to ensure her safety.",

  "description": "In the Tsuchigumo clan's village, Hotaru notices the stares and glares being given to her by the villagers. She asks her uncle, the Tsuchigumo Chief, if she should have returned, and he assures her fears that it is alright as the village is her room. He leaders her to a small room, telling her to stay in there. However, she is soon ambushed by the four bandits. To make matters worse, her uncle overhears the ordeal and smiles as he bars the door to her room, ignoring her cries for help and preventing her from escaping.\nOne of the members, Nangō, manages to restrain her and steal the forbidden scroll from her pack, although it explodes when it is opened. As the explosion destroys the house, Hotaru flees. The four bandits manage to catch up to her in the woods, but she is saved by the arrival of Utakata, who takes her and leaves the area. Before they can pursue him, their leader Shiranami, who has the Tsuchigomo clan crest on his back, notifies them that Utakata is wanted by Kirigakure and that he has a bounty of 50 million ryo.\nNaruto heads to the Tsuchigomo clan's village, where he finds out that Hotaru was attacked and that she had fled. However, he is immensely angered when he finds out that her uncle and the villagers are aware that she may be injured and did not bother to look for her, having no regard for her welfare. Yamato and Sai also arrive, and the captain reminds Naruto that Hotaru's safety is their priority, not the villagers' actions. Attempting to track Hotaru, Sai asks Yamato why they must find her since their mission was to just escort her to the village. Yamato explains that since the mission is based on a secret treaty signed by En no Gyōja and the Third Hokage, in the event that her village is unable to protect her, they must step up and do so. Sai then uses his Super Beast Imitating Drawing technique to create small ink mice to find Hotaru.\nMeanwhile, Utakata uses his Water Release: Bubbles Technique — Drift to carry himself and Hotaru to safety. When asked why he had saved her, he attempts to bluff and claims that he is after the forbidden jutsu as well, although she is able to see through his lies. He asks why she does not give the kinjutsu up to save her life, and learns that her grandfather was her original master and that she wishes to honour his wishes to protect the technique and restore the Tsuchigomo clan. Utakata, having been assaulted by his own master, cannot understand the student-master bond that Hotaru feels. Hotaru proceeds to remove her top, and Utakata becomes embarrassed to see her breasts. However, she turns around to reveal her bare back to him, prompting Utakata to wonder how someone could have done something like that to her. Covering up, she tells him that she did not want to keep any secrets from him since he is to be her master. Angered by the use of the word 'master', Utakata decides to leave her, unaware that he is being watched by a Kiri hunter-nin.\nThe hunter-nin uses his Secret Technique: Mist Rain to render Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu useless and proceeds to use his Water Release: Water Whip to take Hotaru hostage. The hunter-nin asks Utakata to surrender himself lest he allow Hotaru to die on his behalf; he accepts, although he is restrained by the Water Whip technique performed by two other hunter-nin. As Hotaru pleads with them to let Utakata go, the hunter-nin holding her hostage tells her that he is a wanted criminal who had killed his master and fled the village. Just at that moment, one of the hunter-nin is struck by Naruto's Rasengan; Yamato and Sai arrive as well, and Naruto apologises to Hotaru for having taken so long.",

Their clash is interrupted by Tsurugi, the commander of the hunter-nin's unit. Since Team 7 refuses to hand over Utakata in exchange for Hotaru, Tsurugi offers a counter-proposal — Utakata would be allowed to stay with Hotaru until Team 7's mission is done, at which point Team 7 is relinquish Utakata to Kirigakure; failure to comply could incite a war between the nations. As Yamato agrees, Tsurugi asks for a private conversation with Utakata. He asks Utakata to return to Kirigakure, claiming that they are not known as the \"Blood Mist Village\" anymore and that things are peaceful there, and that the village won't kill him since he possesses something they need within him. Utakata refutes Tsurugi's words, not wishing to trust him, stating that the last time he trusted someone, who happened to be his master, the latter turned around and tried to kill him.\nWith Yamato and Tsurugi having agreed to a negotiation, the hunter-nin flee. On their way back to Mount Katsuragi in order to reunite with Sakura and Tonbee, Hotaru wonders why Utakata does not wish to be her master. Naruto tells her about his master, adding that since he did not have any parents growing up, travelling with Jiraiya made him wonder if that is what it felt like to have a father, and that he even found himself acting like a son. He recalls how hard he trained under his master, and reassures Hotaru that so long as she possessed the will, she will be his student. However, Hotaru collapses from pain, and Naruto notices that her shoulder is hurt. Utakata realises that it is her back, and asks for some privacy while tasking Naruto with finding some medicinal herbs. As Naruto retrieves the herbs and makes his way back, he is stunned when he sees Hotaru's bare back, with contains a scarred seal. Utakata reveals that the scar is the Tsuchigumo clan's forbidden technique, which was engraved on to her. Filled with rage, Utakata declares that he has no care for those who merely use people as tools or vessels with no regard for their welfare.",

  "description": "Naruto is enraged upon seeing the seal upon Hotaru's back, remembering how he was treated during his childhood for being a jinchūriki. Back at Mount Katsuragi, Naruto pressures Tonbee and asks how he could have allowed En no Gyōja to have sealed the Tsuchigumo clan's forbidden technique within his own granddaughter. However, Hotaru reveals that she had specifically asked for it, since it was her grandfather's wishes to use the kinjutsu to restore the clan to its former glory and that a student must obey his or her master's wishes. Utakata shuns her for her opinion, remembering being strapped down and attacked by his own master, Harusame. Tonbee decides that for the sake of the clan and for Hotaru's safety, he will remove the seal from her back, thus rendering the forbidden technique useless; he adds that En no Gyōja would never have sealed the kinjutsu on her back if there was no way to undo it, prompting that no master would do such a thing. As Utakata muses whether Tsurugi's words regarding his master Harusame's intentions, the group is unaware that they are being spied by Shiranami, the leader of the four bandits, who has heard their entire conversation. After Hotaru refuses to have the seal removed, she is slapped by Utakata and flees; Naruto, Utakata and Sakura follow her while Sai, under personal instructions from Yamato, stays behind.\nAt En no Gyōja's grave, Naruto and Utakata convince Hotaru to return and have her seal removed. Hotaru, nonetheless, finds another alternative — she reveals that her grandfather's very first pupil, Hāto, had a son named Shiranami who possessed even greater skill than his father, and that if Shiranami received the clan's forbidden technique then their hopes for clan restoration would not be lost. Shiranami, who is eavesdropping on their conversation, is surprised to hear his name being spoken. Naruto, understanding what it feels like to have a power sealed within the body and being hunted because of it, promises Hotaru that he will find Shiranami.\nNaruto uses his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to travel through various villages until he finds a man who knows where Shiranami lives. In Konoha, Tsunade and Shizune receive word through Sai's ink bird, who relays the situation to them. In order to prevent the clan's forbidden technique from being used by another nation, Tsunade agrees for Konoha to protect and give Hotaru refuge while the seal is either removed or passed down to Shiranami.\nMeanwhile, Utakata decides to leave Mount Katsuragi and drifts through mid-air in his bubble, wanting to lure Tsurugi out so that they may talk. The Kiri hunter-nin spot Utakata and decide to intercept him, only to find their path blocked by one of Pain's multi-headed dogs.",

  "description": "Naruto arrives at Shiranami's cabin, only to be bound by ropes. Looking up, he is shocked to see the Magaki Group, the four bandits who had attacked Hotaru earlier. Meanwhile, Hotaru is encountered by Shiranami, who explains how his father Hāto had been killed by enemy shinobi who wanted the Tsuchigumo clan's forbidden technique, and how En no Gyōja had banished him elsewhere since he knew how to use the kinjutsu as well. Glad to have found Shiranami, Hotaru writes a note to Utakata and sends a carrier pigeon to deliver the message; angered, Shiranami uses his Character Bind Technique to have a kanji appear on his hand and take flight, in an attempt to chase down the carrier bird, while he knocks Hotaru out.\nDrifting in his bubble, Utakata witnesses the carrier pigeon being chased and saves it by dispelling the kanji. Upon reading the note, he finds himself glad to be rid of Hotaru since she has found Shiranami, although he is also unsettled. Meanwhile in the cabin, Naruto is shocked to find out that Shiranami is the leader of the bandits; the bandits proceed to trap Naruto in a purple barrier that siphons his chakra, with Chūshin claiming that no one could escape from it. Naruto, drawing on the power of the Nine-Tails' chakra, overloads the barrier and causes the cabin to explode. The four bandits decide to up the ante and create a more powerful variant of their barrier, which renders Naruto unconscious. Before they can kill Naruto, the bandits are attacked by Utakata, who had heard how Shiranami was their leader. Enraged and wanting to know where Hotaru is, Utakata enters into his initial jinchūriki form, and the four bandits decide to leave.\nAt Mount Katsuragi, Yamato is told by Sai that Hotaru has gone missing. In the woods, Utakata searches the ground for clues, telling Naruto that both Hotaru's master and his master have not trained them properly since they lack the basics. Naruto claims that Jiraiya did teach him the basics, as well as honed his taijutsu and ninjutsu while also teaching him powerful techniques. He asks what Utakata learned from his master, and Utakata recalls a memory in which his master berated him for risking his life unnecessarily while also showing his gratitude that his pupil was alive.\nUtakata and Naruto find themselves at the Tsuchigumo clan's village, where they find out that all the villagers are being controlled by Shiranami. Whilst trying to defend themselves without killing the villagers, they are encountered by the four bandits, who use explosive tags. However, the duo are saved by the arrival of Team 7; Yamato uses his Wood Release to restrain the villagers while using his Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall to shield himself, Sai and Sakura while Utakata shields himself and Naruto with his Bubble Dome. Yamato tells the two to go on save Hotaru while they deal with the external foes. Inside his hideout, Shiranami reveals to Hotaru, as he prepares to steal the kinjutsu, that it was he who killed his own father just to acquire the forbidden technique.",

Utakata and Naruto follow the trail of the gathered chakra, where see Hotaru being controlled by the Character Bind Technique.

Naruto attempts to punch him, but is stamped with the kanji through Shiranami's Character Bind technique, who proceeds to do the same to Utakata.

Outside, Yamato, Sakura and Sai have difficulty defeating the Magaki Group as well the manipulated villagers who are attacking them. As Shiranami uses his kanji to dispel the shadow clones, he unleashes Fury, the Tsuchigumo clan's forbidden technique.",

Shiranami flees the scene knowing that the technique is now out of control and the latter is able to destroy the village; Naruto chases after him to get him back.

  "description": "The five members of the Akatsuki finish sealing the Six-Tails inside the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, killing its jinchūriki host. Tobi tells Konan that he has tasked Taka, Sasuke's team, with the retrieval of the Eight-Tails, vouching for Sasuke's credibility and success.\nAt home, Naruto remembers his last encounter with Itachi, where Itachi had placed him under a genjutsu where they could talk in peace. Itachi had asked Naruto what he would do if Sasuke were to attack Konoha, since Naruto views Sasuke as his brother, and asks if Naruto would kill him. Naruto replied that he would save the village without murdering Sasuke in the process. Itachi calls him a childish fool, claiming that shinobi must make hard decisions, prompting Naruto to remember when Jiraiya had told him to give up on Sasuke since shinobi must make such decisions. Naruto promptly told Itachi that he would not give up on Sasuke as it was part of his ninja way; Itachi proceeded to smile and stored his crow inside Naruto, telling the former that he was sharing some of his power with him in the event Sasuke did decide to attack the village. Naruto mulls over Itachi's words and wonders how Sasuke is doing at the moment.\nClutching his eyes in pain, Sasuke and Jūgo, the latter carrying the unconscious Karin and Suigetsu, make their way back to the Akatsuki hideout, where Sasuke hands Killer B's body over to Madara. As Sasuke begins to leave, Madara asks him where he is going; Sasuke replies that first, he would tend to his wounds, and then proceed to destroy Konohagakure. Madara smiles as he recalls a conversation with Sasuke, in which he had asked Sasuke if his goal to destroy Konoha would be halted by Itachi's goal of saving it. Sasuke had responded that he held the two members of the Konoha Council and Danzō Shimura responsible and thus would kill them, as those three were the ones who ordered Itachi to murder his own clan, including his mother and father. Sasuke told Madara that Itachi was unable to kill him that night because Itachi viewed Sasuke's life as more precious than the village's; similarly, Sasuke finds that Itachi's life is more precious than the village's, and wishes to slaughter everyone who lives in Konoha, stating that they are all equally as guilty for living in the safe and peaceful environment that Itachi had sacrificed everything for. Having noticed Madara's unresponsive manner, Sasuke reminded the Uchiha that while the former may write him off as an emotional brat, he does not care for anyone who thinks of him in a different manner and that his love for Itachi and the subsequent inconsolable grief that came after his death would cause him to assassinate anybody who stood in his way. Meanwhile in Kumogakure, J tells the Raikage that his brother Killer B has been abducted by an Akatsuki member who is an Uchiha from Konoha.\nBack in the village, Naruto is awoken by Kakashi, who tells him that Tsunade has summoned him. On the way to the Hokage's office, Naruto spots Gamabunta and Gamakichi, wondering why the two toads are there and why Kakashi is being silent. Inside Tsunade's office, Naruto is greeted by Fukasaku, one of the Two Great Sage Toads and Jiraiya's very own master. Naruto is insulted when Fukasaku refers to Jiraiya as a \"boy\" while the toad is amused that Naruto refers to Jiraiya as a pervy sage. Fukasaku, however, reveals to Naruto that Jiraiya has died during his battle with Pain. Naruto is heartbroken and unable to form a response as Kakashi wonders how Jiraiya had died. Fukasaku reveals to them that Jiraiya had found out that Pain, the leader of the Akatsuki, was operating out Amegakure and had decided to infiltrate the village to confront him. Upon meeting Pain, Jiraiya found out that Pain was actually his former student Nagato. Kakashi and Shizune are shocked when Fugasaku adds that Pain, along with five others, possess the Rinnegan. Kakashi is unable to believe that there are six Rinnegan wielders in the world while Shizune reveals that it was thought to be a mythical dojutsu once wielded by the Sage of Six Paths. Removing his robe, Fukasaku shows them the code Jiraiya had engraved onto his back.\nNaruto decides to blame Tsunade for Jiraiya's death, telling her that she shouldn't have sent him on such a dangerous mission. As he leaves, he tells Tsunade that had Jiraiya been the Fifth Hokage, he would never have sent her on the same mission. Kakashi attempts to apologise to Fukasaku for Naruto's behaviour, but the sage toad tells Kakashi that he can see that Naruto cared for and loved Jiraiya, and that he believes, more than anything after seeing how much Jiraiya meant to him, that Naruto is the Child of the Prophecy. As he walks home, Naruto recalls certain memories involving Jiraiya — when he first summoned Gamabunta, when Jiraiya had asked him to accompany him on his search for Tsunade, and how Jiraiya had told him that Naruto reminded him of the Fourth Hokage. As he remembers Jiraiya giving him a popsicle stick, Naruto notices the leaves in the air and stares up at the sky, saddened.",

  "description": "Naruto leaves Tsunade's office as the Great Sage Toad Fukasaku muses how he hopes Naruto is the Child of the Prophecy. He reveals that before Jiraiya died, he managed to capture one of the Ame-nin, and that Jiraiya also managed to kill one of Pain's six bodies, which Fukasaku has in his possession. After giving the corpse to Tsunade, the Hokage orders Shizune to prep an autopsy unit. Fukasaku also has a picture of his back taken, asking the Hokage to decipher the clue and notify him, as well as to notify Naruto that he can always be reached at Mount Myōboku.\nOn his walk home, Naruto smiles as he sees an Icha Icha poster and remembers how Jiraiya would always peek at nude women, citing it as research for his books, and remembers his his first journey with Jiraiya. He encounters Iruka, who claims that the village is talking about him and offers to catch up over at Ramen Ichiraku, willing to treat him; however, Naruto refuses, wishing to be alone.\nIn her office, Tsunade tasks Shikamaru with deciphering the code as she leaves, crying as she remembers her last words with Jiraiya. At home, Naruto begins to cry and decides to take a walk late at night. After buying a popsicle, he sits down on a bench and allows the tears to stream from his face. Iruka walks up to him and consoles him as Naruto expresses how one of his wishes was to have Jiraiya witness his ascension to Hokage and how Jiraiya only knew the clueless Naruto during his time alive. Iruka reminds Naruto that he is a disciple of the Sannin and that Jiraiya always spoke highly of him, having considered him as a grandson, and that Naruto should continue to be the shinobi that he was so proud of. Iruka breaks the popsicle in two, taking one, akin to what Jiraiya used to do.\nAfter Mitoku and Shiho of the Konoha Cryptanalysis Team notify Shikamaru that Jiraiya's code could only be broken by those closest to him, Shikamaru asks Tsunade and Kakashi, who cannot decipher it. Shikamaru then heads to Naruto's house, only to find the genin depressed. In order to snap him out of his funk, Shikamaru brings Naruto to the hospital to meet a pregnant Kurenai, and reveals that Asuma had entrusted him to be their child's teacher. He reminds Naruto that he knows what it feels like to have a teacher killed but that instead of crying about it, they should move on, and evolve from students to teachers, honouring the teachers they had themselves. Recalling a happy image of Jiraiya, Naruto smiles, and Shikamaru gives him Jiraiya's code to decipher.",

  "description": "While looking at Jiraiya's code, Naruto states that the \"9\" they've been looking at is actually a writing quirk of Jiraiya's penmanship, and that it is actually the katakana letter \"ta\"(タ), something only Naruto would have known. As Naruto reveals that he only learned of the quirk due to Jiraiya's novels, the Konoha Cryptanalysis Team state that the message must have been meant for Naruto, and that the other numbers must mean page numbers from the Icha Icha series. To Kakashi's embarrassment, he is forced to read excerpts from Jiraiya's adult books out loud until they manage to decipher the code — \"The real one's not among them\".\nAfter relaying the decryption to Fukasaku, who remembers Jiraiya telling him that neither of the Six Paths of Pain looked like Nagato, Fukasaku asks Tsunade's permission to bring Naruto with him to Mount Myōboku, in order for Naruto to learn Sage Mode. Naruto accepts, due to his desire to avenge Jiraiya's death, and is reverse summoned to Mount Myōboku. As Naruto and Fukasaku leave, Tsunade muses how the Great Toad Sage had predicted Jiraiya writing novels and how those very novels lead to the decryption of his code, and decides to believe in the toad's prognostication that Naruto is the Child of the Prophecy.\nAt Mount Myōboku, Naruto discovers that he was summoned there by Gamakichi, as toads can summon humans who have signed a blood contract with them. After having one of Shima's meals, Fukasaku explains the basics behind senjutsu, with Gamakichi simplifying it for the genin. After Fukasaku states that Naruto must learn to acquire natural energy, Gamakichi tells Naruto that he would have to die first.",

Fukasaku reveals that toad oil has the ability to acquire natural energy, and if Naruto rubs some on his skin, he will begin to sense natural energy; however, a side affect is that Naruto begins to transform into a frog, gained webbed hands and amphibious pupils. Using his baton, Fukasaku knocks the natural energy out of Naruto, reverting the transformation. Gamakichi explains that his jab about Naruto dying referred to the fact that he'd lose his humanity once he became a frog forever, and Fukasaku reveals to Naruto that even Jiraiya retained frog features after using Sage Mode.\nNaruto decides to expedite his rigorous training using his shadow clones, which Fukasaku allows. Despite being constantly beaten by the sage toad, Naruto begins to sense the natural energy around him. In order to test Naruto's progress, Fukasaku asks Naruto use senjutsu to lift a toad statue, which the genin is able to do, much to Gamakichi's surprise; Fukasaku muses how Naruto has picked up the basics much faster than Jiraiya ever did. Fukasaku tells Naruto is to learn how to absorb natural energy without the use of toad oil, but decides to give the shinobi a break from their training. He then proceeds to give Naruto the very first novel Jiraiya ever wrote — The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi.\nAs Naruto reads the book, he realises that the hero of the book is also named Naruto. He sees Jiraiya's photo on the back of the book and begins to shed a tear as he recalls a memory from their training days, in which Jiraiya had hoped to change the world with his books and expressed gratitude over having Naruto as a student. Naruto had mocked his books and how they never sold, and Jiraiya had retorted that he would not give an autographed copy to Naruto. As Naruto smiles, he thanks Jiraiya for giving him something much more priceless.\nMeanwhile, Madara notifies the other Akatsuki members that Sasuke has successfully captured the Eight-Tails. As they prepare to seal it, Pain reveals his new body and proceeds to declare that the Six Paths of Pain are heading to Konoha; Zetsu, Konan, Madara and Kisame begin to seal Killer B into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, only for the jinchūriki to be nothing more than an severed octopus appendage.",

Fukasaku tells Naruto that the key is to focus, and thus leads Naruto atop a bunch of spires, telling the genin to learn how to concentrate and stay still without moving, lest he plummet all the way down. After Naruto fails to do so, being caught by Fukasaku's tongue, the sage toad remembers Jiraiya's training.\nAfter learning that Jiraiya had done the very same training but had taken years to master it, Naruto claims he does not have such time and thus creates two shadow clones to expedite his progress. After a short while, Naruto and his two shadow clones manage to balance themselves on a board placed upon a spire, sitting without moving for an entire day, even through a period of rain. As Naruto manages to enter into a perfect Sage Mode, Fukasaku marvels how quickly Naruto has managed to use senjutsu without the aid of the toad oil and how he may surpass Jiraiya very soon. However, a bird lands on Naruto's shoulder and he loses his concentration, falling straight to the ground. After his fall creates an impact on the ground, Naruto realises that he has not been injured in anyway; Fukasaku reveals that Sage Mode grants the user much more durability, agility, and strength, making Naruto even more agile and boosting his already rapid recovery rate. Fukasaku then adds that Naruto has one more step to master — the art of the Frog Kata, a taijutsu exclusive to those who have mastered Sage Mode.\nMeanwhile, Taka sequester themselves in a hideout in Kumogakure. Suigetsu expresses dismay at the fact that his Kubikiribōchō was left behind in the Valley of Clouds and Lightning, and asks Sasuke whether the Akatsuki would really hand over the power of a tailed beast to them. Sasuke responds that he does not need that power now that he possesses the Mangekyō Sharingan, only for him to clutch his eyes as his vision becomes blurred. Karin, however, alerts them that she senses a chakra signature outside their hideout. J, a Kumo shinobi, has located them and attempts to use a Messenger Lizard to communicate back with his partner, K; however, Sasuke kills the lizard with his sword as Jūgo deals with J.\nAt the Raikage's office, the Kage is infuriated that Sasuke of the Akatsuki has kidnapped his brother and demands to know why the Hokage of Konoha had not dealt with him yet. Wanting to retrieve his brother, the Raikage orders his aide to gather intel from Tsunade regarding Sasuke and dispatches Team Samui, a squad trained by Killer B, to retrieve him from the Akatsuki's clutches; he also decides to host a Five Kage Summit to deal with the problem of the Akatsuki.\nBack at Mount Myōboku, Naruto begins to wonder whether he could try something under the effects of Sage Mode, but dismisses the thought to Fukasaku. After getting the hang of Frog Kata, Fukasaku and Naruto decide to rest up for the night. However, after the sage toad falls asleep, Naruto quietly leaves and decides to attempt a technique using Sage Mode. After having succeeded, Naruto muses to himself that he shall try to continue honing this technique in secret, without anybody finding out.",

  "description": "Pain begins his invasion on Konohagakure, killing the border shinobi without difficulty. He assigns the Asura Path, Animal Path and the Preta Path to the assault team while the Naraka Path, Deva Path and Human Path, along with Konan, are ordered to search for Naruto Uzumaki. Using his Rinnegan, Pain senses the barrier shielding the village, Pain tricks the Konoha Barrier Team into expecting only one intruder when he has the Animal Path enter the barrier through the air, only for the Animal Path to summon the other five once inside the village.\nBack at Mount Myōboku, Shima heads to Konoha in order to procure ingredients for dinner while Fukasaku divulges the downsides of Sage Mode to Naruto. He explains that the user must stand still and focus in order to enter Sage Mode, and Naruto dismisses the senjutsu training as a waste of time. However, Fukasaku reveals that during Jiraiya's fight with Pain, Jiraiya summoned him and Shima so that they could sit still on his shoulder and gather the natural energy needed while Jiraiya fought, and that Naruto could do the same thing if he needs to use Sage Mode in batte.\nMeanwhile, Inoichi performs a mind-reading technique on Yūdachi, an Ame-nin captured by Jiraiya. After some arduousness, Inoichi succeeds in getting through the mind blocks; however, his daughter Ino rushes in to alert the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force that Konoha is under attack. Back at the hospital, Shizune and her team are performing an autopsy on the previous Animal Path corpse, and she discovers that the rods pierced in the Animal Path's body are chakra receivers that are currently gathering chakra. After the explosion that occurred, Sakura encounters a Giant Centipede summoned by the new Animal Path and defeats it with a single blow, saving a woman and her grandchild. Iruka tells Sakura to head to the Konoha Hospital as the other chūnin attempt to protect their village.\nIn her office, Tsunade is told by the Konoha Barrier Team that they only detected one intruder, although there are many more currently assaulting the village. One of the Anbu members notifies her that the intruders are wearing black robes with red clouds; realising that the Akatsuki have finally come for them, and remembering Fukasaku's remarks about Naruto being the Child of the Prophecy, Tsunade orders them to retrieve Naruto.",

  "description": "Konan and the Six Paths of Pain continue their attack on Konohagakure while systematically interrogating and killing shinobi and civilians alike regarding the whereabouts of Naruto Uzumaki, the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Due to Tsunade's duties as Hokage and Shizune leading the autopsy, Sakura is placed in charge of all the wounded at the Konoha Hospital. Danzō Shimura decides to alert Koharu Utatane and Homura Mitokado, the two elders of the Konoha Council, that Pain of the Akatsuki is destroying their village in an attempt to find Naruto, whom Tsunade is attempting to bring back to the village at the very moment.\nAngered, the two elders storm into Tsunade's office, asking her to leave Naruto at Mount Myōboku, unsatisfied with her handling of events. As the elders mention the dangers of handing the Nine-Tails over to Pain, who had killed Jiraiya of all people, Tsunade is vexed as they refer to Naruto as merely the vessel of the tailed beast. Pulling them off their feet by their collars, she announces that Naruto is not just a vessel, but a shinobi of Konoha, a comrade, who has sworn to defend their village, recalling when Naruto saved her during her battle with Kabuto; she proceeds to tell the elders that the Third Hokage, Chiyo of Suna and Jiraiya all possessed something that the two of them lack — the power to believe, to have faith, in someone like Naruto. Back at Mount Myōboku, Naruto has perfected becoming one with nature and proceeds to use his Sage Mode to hone a certain technique.\nShizune rushes in to Tsunade's office, revealing that they found chakra receivers within the body Jiraiya procured, and that the very chakra receiver is still working. Musing why Pain is sending chakra to the other bodies, Tsunade orders Kōsuke, a messenger toad, to return to Mount Myōboku and relay the situation to Naruto and Fukasaku; Tsunade then proceeds to head to the roof. As everyone clears out of the office, Kōsuke prepares to dispel himself back home, only to be stabbed and killed by Danzō, who does not want the Nine-Tails to return to Konoha. On the roof, Tsunade summons Katsuyu and tells her to use her Slug Great Division to split into numerous, smaller slugs and heal the wounded, swearing to protect the village as Hokage. Meanwhile, Pain's Deva Path interrogates Iruka, who does not divulge Naruto's location. Before Pain can kill Iruka, he is saved by Kakashi, who prepares to deal with the Deva Path himself while Iruka escapes.",

  "description": "Kakashi engages in combat against the Deva Path, attempting to strike it with his Lightning Cutter. Using his Rinnegan, Pain is able to disrupt Kakashi, who loses focus and is thus unable to strike Pain. Using the Deva Path's Shinra Tensei ability, Pain repels Kakashi, causing an explosion. Amidst the rubble, Kakashi emerges, and proceeds to use his Lightning Release: Lightning Beast Tracking Fang to attack the Deva Path, although the attack is blocked by the arrival of the Asura Path. Using his Banshō Ten'in technique, Pain pulls Kakashi towards the Asura Path's blade, impaling him and seemingly killing him.\nThe impaled Kakashi turns out to be none other than a Lightning Release shadow clone, while the real Kakashi surfaces from the rubble. He is joined by reinforcements, consisting of Chōji, Chōza and Shitō Akimichi of the Akimichi clan, as well as three other shinobi. Chōji and Chōza use their Partial Multi-Size Technique to crush the Asura Path as the other three attempt to take out the Deva Path, only for Pain to use its Shinra Tensei to repel and subsequently kill them. Kakashi realises that the Deva Path has a recharge period of five seconds between attacks, and decides to take advantage of the interval by attempting to kill Pain with his Lightning Cutter, only for the Asura Path, who is still able to move, to shield the Deva Path with its body. Wanting to take advantage of the interval once more, Kakashi throws a chain underground and uses his Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique to attack Pain, but the Deva Path counters with Shinra Tensei to repel Kakashi. Kakashi uses the chain to bind Pain while Chōji and Chōza use their Double Human Bullet Tank to crush the Deva Path. However, Pain manages to repel both Akimichi clan members, with Chōza shielding Chōji with his body.\nDiscerning that the trapped Kakashi is not a shadow clone, Pain's Deva Path uses a nail from a wooden board and fires it at Kakashi's head, seemingly killing him. The Deva Path then leaves, unaware that Chōji is still alive. Chōji notices his father's body and cries, mourning his father's death. Kakashi, who is barely alive, orders Chōji to mourn later and to take the opportunity to report the Deva Path's abilities to Tsunade, who is channelling her chakra along with Katsuyu in order to heal the wounded. As Chōji runs, the Asura Path, who is still alive, fires a missile at him, intending to kill him. Kakashi depletes his remaining chakra to activate his Mangekyō Sharingan, using its Kamui ability to warp the missile away; the Asura Path realises that Kakashi had used Kamui to warp away the nail that was fired at him earlier. Kakashi then dies from his wounds and lack of chakra, eager to see Obito, Rin and Minato in the afterlife, although he ends up encountering his father, who asks Kakashi to share his tale.\nKatsuyu reports to Tsunade that Kakashi has died, causing Tsunade to temporarily stop her technique so she could vent her anger and frustration out. As Chōji delivers the Deva Path's profile and abilities, Tsunade thanks him and tells him that Chōza is still alive, and to bring him to the hospital. Chōji asks if Kakashi is alive as well, only for Tsunade to walk away.",

  "description": "At Mount Myōboku, Naruto wonders whether the Akatsuki would ever attack Konoha just to find him, while Fukasaku assures him that no such thing would happen; even if it did, Kōsuke, the messenger toad, would alert them. Fukasaku then decides to begin training on the third and final step to using Sage Mode in battle — fusing Fukasaku on his shoulder.\nIn Konoha, Danzō alerts his Anbu Root unit that they would be hiding underground until Pain's assault comes to an end, adding that they would not be providing any support as the village's crisis would result in his promotion to Hokage, and thus any casualties would be considered as sacrifices for the greater good.\nMeanwhile, Inoichi continues his interrogation and probing of Yūdachi's mind, finding a memory in which Yūdachi and Ryūsui delivered a corpse to Konan, who was to deliver it to Pain himself. The Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force is then attacked by Pain's Animal Path, who summons a Giant Rhino to destroy the building. Inoichi recognises her as the corpse in Yūdachi's memories, and flees with Ino and Shizune, who are protected by Katsuyu; Shizune, however, wonders how this Pain is able to summon when Jiraiya had already defeated the one that could. Ibiki and the others decide to attempt defeating the Animal Path, who summons a Giant Ox, a Giant Multi-Headed Dog and a Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon. The Anbu unit attempts to defeat the dog, only for it to survive and continue its rampage.\nIbiki traps the Giant Rhino using his Summoning: Iron Maiden technique while binding the Animal Path and summoning a torture chamber. He attempts to use pain to extract information, only to realise that the Path's body is cold and responsive as a corpse. Easily breaking free of the shackles, Pain tells Ibiki that he shall know what true pain is, and proceeds to his stomach as a conduit to summon a Giant Drill-Beaked Bird. The Anbu unit attempts to defeat the giant multi-headed dog once more, only for the dog to break free again; the giant rhino also breaks free of the Iron Maiden.\nBack at Mount Myōboku, Fukasaku attempts to fuse with Naruto, only for the Nine-Tailed Fox to reject him, forcing Naruto find an alternate method of acquiring natural energy during battle.",

  "description": "Team Ebisu notices the damage being wrought on their village by Pain, while Konohamaru decides to join the battle using a new technique that Naruto had taught him. Shortly after Shikamaru had told him that it was time for him to start being a teacher, Naruto decided to teach Konohamaru the Rasengan. As Naruto began explaining the three-part process, Konohamaru initially believed it to be a new Sexy Technique; Naruto, however, told him that it was a powerful, A-ranked technique. Moegi and Udon, however, convince Konohamaru not to enter the fray and that as genin, they should simply evacuate the villagers to a safe shelter, prompting Konohamaru to recall when he was among those being evacuated during the Konoha Crush.\nAs he helps rescue an old lady from the rubble, Konohamaru witnesses two chūnin being attacked by the Naraka Path, who interrogates them regarding Naruto's whereabouts and proceeds to rip the tongues out of those who are withholding information. After accidentally revealing his location, the Naraka Path begins to close in on him. Konohamaru's sensei, Ebisu, engages in combat against Pain in order to give Konohamaru time to escape. Konohamaru is unable to move out of fear and witness his master being defeated by Pain, who threatens to kill Ebisu if he does not disclose information about Naruto. Ebisu tells Pain that when he first met Naruto, he thought of him as someone who would interfere with Konohamaru's training, only for Naruto to prove himself as a shinobi who could impart lessons to Konohamaru that he could not, and that he would not divulge anything about a fellow Konoha shinobi to Pain. Pain decides to kill Ebisu for his silence, but Konohamaru saves him by throwing kunai at the Naraka Path's arm.\nThe Naraka Path is easily able to subdue Konohamaru, and summons the King of Hell in order to extract information about Naruto. However, Konohamaru reveals himself to be nothing more than a shadow clone as the real Konohamaru, along with another shadow clone, rushes at the Naraka Path and strikes him in the gut with Rasengan, leaving Ebisu shocked and surprised as to how and when Konohamaru learned such a technique. Konohamaru then tells the Naraka Path that his name is Konohamaru Sarutobi and to never forget it.\nBack at Mount Myōboku, Naruto attempts to run while gathering natural energy in order to test whether he can activate Sage Mode when on the move, only to fail. Fukasaku tells him apologetically that the method would never work and claims that Sage Mode is not for everyone. After seeing the message Jiraiya left on Fukasaku's back, Naruto tells him that it was also a message from Jiraiya telling Naruto to never give up. Fukasaku attempts to explain that the impossible simply cannot be done, comparing it to looking left and right at the same time. Naruto is stunned when he hears those words and exclaims that there is a way after all.",

The Preta Path uses the body of the first Animal Path to shield the attack while he flees. At the same time, Shino, his father, and another member of his clan engage in combat against Konan, who uses paper clones rigger with explosive tags in an attempt to kill them. In the meantime, Pain's Deva Path arrives on the roof of the Hokage's office in order to speak with Tsunade.\nTsunade recognises the Deva Path as Yahiko, one of the Ame Orphans she had met long ago, and Pain is amused that she remembers him. After expressing their conflicting views on peace, Pain is visibly angered by Tsunade's refusal to surrender the Nine-Tails and accept Akatsuki's offer to surrender. Elsewhere, Ino, Inoichi and Shizune are uncovering the truth behind the Six Paths of Pain when the Human Parth arrives and kills Shizune by absorbing her soul, although he manages to extract information from her mind and discovers that Naruto is at Mount Myōboku. Having discovered Naruto's location, the second Animal Path summons Konan and five Paths (save the Deva Path) to the forest outside the village.\nAt Mount Myōboku, Gamatama informs Naruto and Fukasaku that Kōsuke, the messenger toad they left at Konoha, is deceased, since his name has disappeared from the toad register. Fearing that the Akatsuki are attacking Konoha, Fukasaku tells Naruto to get ready to defend the village as he tasks Gamaden to use the Distant Body Water portal to transport himself immediately to Konoha, where he is to instruct Shima to summon the forces from Mount Myōboku.\nIn Konoha, Tsunade angers Pain when the former claims that while Konoha's actions in the past may not have been just, they have already experienced pain. Declaring that Konoha shall know pain for what they did to Yahiko, he notifies Konan that he is going to use that technique, and proceeds to shut down the other five bodies as his Deva Path performs a large-scale Shinra Tensei, reducing the village to a massive crater. Sakura is saved from the blast by Katsuyu and sheds tears as she notices the ruins around her, crying out for Naruto to come and save them. Right on cue, Naruto arrives in Sage Mode, along with Fukasaku, Gamakichi, Gamabunta, Gamahiro and Gamaken.",

  "description": "Naruto is summoned by Shima along with Fukasaku, Gamabunta, Gamakichi, Gamaken and Gamahiro. They are all visibly surprised to see Konohagakure utterly destroyed. Knowing full well that Pain is responsible, Naruto confronts him. Tsunade intervenes and challenges to fight Pain instead, but she proves to be helpless since she used all of her chakra to heal the villagers from Pain's assault. Pain, through the Deva Path, informs her that she is not the one he seeks as the rejuvenated Asura Path moves to attack her. Naruto intervenes, destroying the Path with a Rasengan, and orders Gamakichi to take Tsunade to a safe place and to inform everyone not to interfere in his battle with Pain. Before beginning his battle, he reveals that after mastering senjutsu, he is able to sense chakra signatures, and inquires why he cannot sense Kakashi's, before realising that Kakashi has been killed. Sakura is told by a member of the Hyūga clan, who is using his Byakugan to witness the battle since dust clouds are obstructing Naruto and Pain, that Naruto has destroyed a Path using a single blow.\nThe Animal Path uses Summoning Rinnegan to summon a Giant Multi-Headed Dog, a Giant Ox and a Giant Rhino. Naruto throws the rhino into the air and hits the other two creatures with his Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan; the three giant toads leap into the air to fight the summons. Confronted by Pain's Preta Path, he uses Frog Kata to knock him out, using the natural energy around him to connect the blow despite the Path dodging his fist. Pain notices that Naruto has mastered Sage Mode, just like their master Jiraiya. Naruto is shocked that Pain was Jiraiya's pupil; Pain declares that as \"student siblings\", should have the same vision towards peace, involving Naruto sacrificing his life and handing over the Nine-Tails for that cause. Naruto angrily rejects Pain's ideology, asking if Pain considers his destruction of Konoha as peaceful, and proceeds to form his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. The Hyūga shinobi relays to Sakura that Naruto has formed a chakra shuriken, which Sakura realises is the double-edged Rasenshuriken; however, instead of thrusting the Rasenshuriken physically, Naruto throws it at the four remaining Paths.",

  "description": "Naruto hurls his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken at the five five Paths of Pain, who attempt to get out of its range. However, Naruto expands the Rasenshuriken at the last moment, and the attack destroys Pain's Human Path. Shortly after, Pain notices that Naruto's senjutsu is beginning to wane. Knowing that Naruto cannot fight the remaining four due to all four sharing the same Rinnegan vision, Shima creates a dust cloud to obscure Pain's vision; Fukasaku uses his senjutsu to hurl Gamabunta in Naruto's direction, and the giant toad swallows both Naruto and Pain's Animal Path. With the other Paths unable to see through the dust cloud and the Animal Path unable to see inside Gamabunta's mouth, Naruto uses his remaining senjutsu to form his Spiralling Serial Spheres and rams it at the Animal Path, destroying it. Gamabunta then regurgitates the destroyed Path as well as Naruto, whose Sage Mode is deactivated as he has run out of natural energy.\nThe Deva Path begins to attack Naruto, believing it to be an easy fight now that Naruto is not in Sage Mode. Naruto tosses his scroll to Fukasaku, who summons a Naruto shadow clone that was gathering natural energy back at Mount Myōboku. Naruto then dispels the clone and absorbs the clone's gathered senjutsu, reverting back to his Sage Mode and resuming his fight against Pain. Fukasaku explains to Shima that since they could not fuse with him due to the Nine-Tails rejecting them, Naruto had come up with that creative, ingenious solution to circumvent Sage Mode's five minute duration. Naruto forms another Rasenshuriken and hurls it towards the Deva Path, since Katsuyu reveals to Naruto that he is unable to use any techniques at the moment. However, the technique is absorbed by Preta Path. Naruto wonders how the Preta Path is able to move, since he knocked it out with his Frog Kata, and realises that Pain's Outer Path is able to reanimate the bodies using its King of Hell technique. Knowing that his victory rests on destroying the Outer Path, Naruto forms a strategy.\nNaruto creates two shadow clones and has them form a Rasengan in each of his hands, and then has the clones drop a pellet of red smoke. One of his shadow clones then transforms into the Rasenshuriken as the other clone throws it in the Deva Path's direction, knowing that the Preta Path would catch it and attempt to absorb it. The fake Rasenshuriken promptly reverts back to its shadow clone form just before the Preta Path can catch it, and since that Path's weakness is physical attacks, the Path is easily subdued. Naruto then throws the real Rasenshuriken through the red smoke towards the Deva Path, who does not have anyone guarding his front anymore. However, Pain has regained his abilities and proceeds to use his Shinra Tensei to repel and dissipate the attack. In spite of that, the real Naruto, who had jumped into the air through the guise of the smoke, lands on the Outer Path, using his Spiralling Serial Spheres to destroy it, surprising Gamabunta, Fukasaku and Shima. The Naruto that attacked the Preta Path prepares to kill it, only for Pain, whose five second interval has passed, to use Shinra Tensei again to repel both Naruto and his shadow clone, as well as Gamabunta, Gamahiro and Gamaken. With the three giant toads defeated, Naruto is left to fight the two remaining Paths alone.",

  "description": "Fukasaku and Shima begin to prepare their genjutsu so that Naruto may be able to exploit Pain's five-second intervals. The Deva Path then uses its Banshō Ten'in to pull Naruto towards it as the Preta Path restrains him. Naruto's Sage Mode deactivates as the Preta Path begins to absorb his chakra. Realising that not being able to move is a good thing, Naruto takes the opportunity to stand still and gather natural energy, which the Preta Path acquires. However, the Path consumes too much and turns into a frog statue, effectively being destroyed.\nIrritated yet surprised that he has been pushed this far, the Deva Path uses Banshō Ten'in to pull in Fukasaku and kills him; Naruto, trying to catch the toad, falls to the ground as Pain stabs his hands with his black pole, pinning Naruto. Having trapped the jinchūriki, Pain tells him that the world shall finally know true pain, after which peace shall be created. Naruto calls Pain a hypocrite for preaching about peace after killing Jiraiya and Kakashi while also destroying Konohagakure. Pain explains that he and Naruto are fighting for the very same peace that Jiraiya wanted, and that he is merely having his vengeance on Konoha for what they did to Amegakure during the Second Shinobi World War, in which Ame was treated as a battleground by the Lands of Fire, Wind and Water. Pain states that he lost his family and friends due to the shinobi cycle of hatred and thus understands the pain Naruto must be feeling, and asks Naruto what approach he would take to ensure peace. Naruto recalls Jiraiya bestowing to him his wish to break the cycle of hatred and bring about peace, and responds that he does not have an answer.\nPain divulges that by acquiring the Nine-Tailed Fox, he would soon have the power of all nine tailed beasts, after which he would be able to use their power to destroy entire nations. After such destruction, the world would be frightened and inspired by that very fear to not cause wars and thus peace would be stabilised. As the years pass, eventually the fear would dissipate, after which humans would no doubt use the tailed beasts against one another, once again causing massive destruction that would spur fear and quell conflict.\nMeanwhile, Shikamaru decides that they should find the real Pain as to not let Shizune's death to have been in vain, claiming that they will glean whatever they can from everyone, including dead bodies. Inoichi recalls the memory he had glimpsed inside Yūdachi's mind and remembers that Pain lives in a high tower. Realising that the real Pain must be nearby and in the highest tower near Konoha in order to control the Six Paths of Pain, they decide to locate him. In his tower, a crippled and ill Nagato is revealed to be the true \"Pain\", speaking to Naruto via his Deva Path. Konan notices Nagato coughing blood and tells him that he ought to take it easy, as he has already depleted a lot of chakra.",

  "description": "Team Guy, who were out on a mission, make their way back to Konoha when Neji spots the wounded Gamabunta, recognising the toad as Jiraiya's personal summon. In the village, Hinata is able to spot the pinned Naruto with her Byakugan and recalls memories of first encountering Naruto when she was younger. Her guardian, Kō, had told her to stay away from him as she heard the villagers gossip about the Nine-Tails. However, after a group of thugs pushed her around, Naruto came to her defence. Remembering how Naruto had protected her, Hinata leaps into the battlefield in order to protect Naruto for once.\nNaruto asks why she would enter the fray and attempts to convince her to leave, telling her that this is his battle. Hinata then proceeds to confess her love for Naruto and pulls out one of the black receivers that Pain has embedded inside Naruto. Using his Shinra Tensei, Pain's Deva Path pushes Hinata away. Hinata manages to stands up and activates her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists, and proceeds to run towards and engage in combat with Pain, who tracks the movement with his Rinnegan and is able to evade being struck. However, when Nagato begins to cough blood, he loses his concentration for a brief second, allowing Hinata to land a blow. Seeing the dazed Pain, Hinata pulls out another receiver, and is pushed even further away, this time through the air.\nAs Hinata lands across the crater, she begins to bleed from her head. Naruto cries out for her safety, as Hinata crawls her way back towards Naruto, remembering how Naruto cheered for her during her battle with Neji, and how he had told her that he liked people like her. As she makes her way to Naruto, Pain asks her why she would attempt to fight him or try to save Naruto if she knew she would die as a result, and Hinata claims that she would never give up, as it is her nindo, stunning Naruto. Pain then uses his Shinra Tensei to send Hinata upwards through the air and pulls her back down. As her falling impact cracks the ground, he proceeds to take his blade and stabs her, killing Hinata. As Naruto sees the blood seeping out of her, Pain merely remarks that this is the same way his parents died, being murdered by shinobi from Konoha. Enraged at Pain's callous murder of Hinata, Naruto unleashes the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox and enters into his Version 2 form.",

  "description": "After Hinata is seemingly killed by Pain, Naruto becomes enraged, causing Naruto to transform into his four-tailed form. The Nine-Tails then conjures a twister, which Pain is able to nullify with his Shinra Tensei. The Nine-Tails is able to break the very earth up and hurl it at Pain, who is able to evade most of it, although he suffers a punch from the four-tailed Naruto and is subsequently buried by the debris. Pain emerges, and Naruto's transformation escalates, causing him to grow two more tails and gain a skeletal appearance. Pain proceeds to destroy the ground beneath them, unleashing the water beneath.\nIn his six-tailed form, the Nine-Tails continues his assault on Pain, firing Continuous Tailed Beast Balls which Pain manages to deflect with Shinra Tensei. The tailed beast then decides to stop its attack; as Pain wonders if that is all the beast is capable of, the Nine-Tails takes advantage of Pain's five-second interval to fire more Continuous Tailed Beast Balls, striking Pain. The First Hokage's Necklace attempts to restrain the Nine-Tails' chakra and revert the transformation, only for the Nine-Tails to rip the necklace off and destroy it. The beast then lunges towards Pain, who attempts to repel him with his Shinra Tensei; however, the attack has no effect and the Nine-Tails is able to strike Pain once more. Hinata, who is revealed to be still alive, mutters Naruto's name as the battle ensues around her. The Nine-Tails fires a Tailed Beast Ball at Pain who attempts to counter it with Banshō Ten'in, causing an explosion.\nKō, using his Byakugan, alerts Sakura that Naruto has entered into his six-tailed form; Sakura and Katsuyu decide to have the other villagers evacuate Konoha since Naruto cannot control his transformation. Outside the village, Yamato, Sai and Anko are on a mission to find Kabuto when Yamato sees a kanji burn on his hand. Realising that Naruto has entered into his six-tailed form and that the necklace is destroyed, Yamato abandons the team, telling them that an emergency has sprung up and that he must return to Konoha immediately.\nMeanwhile, Pain begins to flee from the battleground as the six-tailed beast chases him. The Nine-Tails fires its Nine-Tails Beam at Pain, who shields himself with Shinra Tensei. Back in his tower, Nagato muses that the Deva Path is finally close enough for him to use Chibaku Tensei. Using the very earth itself, the Deva Path creates a moon-like sphere, which draws in the six-tailed Naruto and traps him within; the technique, however, causes Nagato to begin bleeding from his nose. Konan asks Nagato why he would create such a large orb as Nagato reminds Konan that their opponent is the Nine-Tails, and that he had to use such measures in order to capture the beast. Enraged, the trapped beast grows an eighth tail and begins to break out of the sphere. Within his subconscious, a trouble Naruto muses how he did not have an answer to Pain's question on how to obtain peace, while the Nine-Tailed Fox convinces him to release the seal that binds him, claiming that once he is given total rein over Naruto's body, he would help him by killing those who have caused Naruto pain. Naruto, under the influence of the fox, is about to sprout his ninth and final tail as Yamato, who is alerted by the kanji on his palm, wonders how Naruto's transformation had progressed that far. Naruto succumbs to the Nine-Tails' will and attempts to rip off the seal and free the fox, only to be stopped by the Fourth Hokage, who dispels the fox's influence on Naruto and greets the boy by name.",

  "description": "Naruto is surprised to see the Fourth Hokage and wonders why the Hokage knows his name. The Fourth Hokage replies that he had implanted his psyche into the seal in the event that Naruto sprouted eight of the nine tails, and hoped that it would never happen, although he is glad to have the opportunity to meet his son. Naruto is shocked to discover that the Fourth Hokage is his father, and sheds tears; however, he proceeds to punch his father in the gut, asking him why he would seal a tailed beast in his own infant son, citing all the trouble he had growing up and being hated due to his jinchuriki status, and that the Akatsuki have destroyed Konoha in order to come after him just because of that.\nThe Fourth Hokage tells Naruto that he sealed half of the fox inside Naruto because Naruto is his son and he believes Naruto would be able to control the power. He also reveals that sixteen years ago, it was a masked man in Akatsuki robes whom he had fought who had manipulated the fox into attacking the village; additionally, he witnessed Naruto's battle with Pain through Naruto and believes that Pain's hatred towards Konoha is being manipulated by the masked man. The Fourth states that he is aware of Jiraiya's death, and tells Naruto that he nor anybody else can answer Pain's question on how to achieve peace, but entrusts his faith that Naruto would find the answer. Tightening and restoring Naruto's seal, he warns his son that he would not be there to seal it again in the future and fades away as his chakra diminishes.\nMeanwhile, Team Guy return to the village, having been notified of Pain's assault by a wounded Gamabunta, and rescue Hinata. Pain is stunned to see Naruto, in his eight-tailed form, breaking out of the Chibaku Tensei, shocked that it was unable to contain the beast. However, the eight-tailed form instantly reverts back into Naruto, who is in Sage Mode. Pain is surprised by the sudden turn of events and ponders whether Naruto has attained full control over his beast in order to quell it and activate Sage Mode at the same time. As Naruto prepares to defeat Pain, he notices the destruction around him, although he is reassured by Katsuyu that he did not harm anybody during his rampage. Naruto tells the Deva Path that he wishes to speak to the real Pain while Pain merely states that once Naruto depletes his senjutsu after firing two Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, he would beat Naruto to inches of his life and haul him away. Using his Frog Kata, Naruto is able to repel Pain and grab one of his black receivers, which he stabs himself with. Sending his natural energy through the receiver, Naruto is able to pinpoint the real Pain's location.\nSince his Version 2 transformation dispelled the other shadow clone he had at Mount Myōboku, Naruto realises he only has five minutes left in Sage Mode; he creates two shadow clones and launches two Rasenshuriken at Pain, who uses Shinra Tensei to nullify the first one while leaping into the air to avoid the second. Naruto then uses Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to have a handful of shadow clones burst from the rubble circling Pain, and attempts to take advantage of the five-second interval to attack him. Pain's interval ends just as the shadow clones reach him, and he uses Shinra Tensei to repel the clones. However, the real Naruto is launched through mid-air towards Pain, and uses the interval to his advantage as he strikes the defenceless Deva Path with his Rasengan.",

  "description": "Sakura begins to heal Hinata from her wounds, musing how Hinata truly loves Naruto, as the latter destroys the Deva Path with his Rasengan. Pulling the black chakra receivers out of the Deva Path's body, Naruto decides to locate the real Pain and talk to him, asking Katsuyu to notify the others not to follow him.\nKatsuyu relays to Sakura, Hinata, Kō and Team Guy that Naruto has successfully defeated the Six Paths of Pain and is now heading out to defeat the final Pain. Neji and Guy decide to give him backup, but Katsuyu relays Naruto's message that this is something he wants to do alone. On his way to the real Pain's location, he is sighted by Inoichi, Shikaku and an unnamed member of the Hyūga clan. Inoichi wants the three of them to tag along with Naruto to defeat Pain, but is outraged when Naruto tells him that he is not going there to kill him but to merely talk to him face-to-face. Shikaku calms Inoichi down and allows Naruto to go on ahead, promising not to follow. As Inoichi asks why Shikaku would do that, Shikaku reveals that his son Shikamaru had mentioned before how Naruto had a way of convincing others to follow in his path and that he would be an important shinobi for Konoha someday. He tells the others that Shikamaru rarely praises anybody, and for Shikamaru to have said those things about Naruto inspires him to have that same faith as well.\nNaruto activates his Sage Mode and is able to sense the real Pain's location. As he enters their hideout, located within a giant tree, he sees Nagato and Konan in front of him. Nagato fires a black chakra receiver towards Naruto and impales him, remarking that he had purposely avoided vital spots since he needs the jinchuriki alive. Naruto, nevertheless, is able to channel the Nine-Tails' chakra through the receiver whilst also maintaining Sage Mode, incapacitating Nagato. Nagato asks Naruto if he hates him, and thinking back upon how Nagato killed Jiraiya and Kakashi, Naruto lunges at Nagato with the intent to kill. As Konan moves in to shield Nagato, Naruto remembers Jiraiya's remarks on how he had hoped to break the cycle of hatred as well as how his father, the Fourth Hokage, had said the current system of hatred would only give birth to those like Pain. Naruto stops his attack and dispels both the Nine-Tails' influence as well as Sage Mode, asking for them to share their stories. He states that Nagato and Konan are unlike the other Akatsuki members who seem to enjoy killing and that he would like to know how they became the way they are despite being taught by Jiraiya, and Nagato agrees to tell him his story.",

In order to practise using Chidori on moving targets, Kakashi sends Sasuke to the temple, where he proceeds to use it on the Ame-nin.\nNaruto and the others find the scroll, only for it to read \"there are no shortcuts to becoming to a ninja\". The others realise that Guy set the whole thing up to hone their skills and reflect how they began the day with individual goals whilst ending it with the hope that at least a Konoha shinobi passes the exams; Naruto, however, decides that the scroll's true meaning is to partake in the entire obstacle course once more, but to take the longer route.",

  "description": "Nagato continues telling his story to Naruto and tells him how fate led the three Ame Orphans to the three legendary Sannin, and how Jiraiya offered to take care of them. After spotting Jiraiya's Konoha forehead protector, Nagato did not accept him, as it was Konoha shinobi who had murdered his mother and father. However, after spending time with Jiraiya, Nagato came to regard him as his sensei.\nOne day, he and Yahiko were attacked by a renegade ninja from Iwagakure. The enemy was about to murder Yahiko, and Nagato used his Rinnegan to kill him. After seeing Nagato's dojutsu, Jiraiya agreed to teach the three orphans ninjutsu and privately confided in Nagato that he viewed him as the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Paths, who wielded the Rinnegan and spoke of obtaining peace and understanding one another. Nagato decided that he would use his power to protect Yahiko and Konan, and after they had gained enough strength to thrive on their own, Jiraiya had left them.\nYahiko, Nagato and Konan travelled throughout Amegakure and recruited various Ame-nin into their newfound organisation, which would find a peaceful solution to the war. Hanzō, the ruler of Ame, perceived them as a threat and invited them to a negotiation under the pretext of quelling the conflicts between the lands of Fire, Wind and Earth. However, the meeting was a trap, consisting of Hanzō's men and Danzō Shimura, a commander from Konoha, who supplied his Root members for the ambush. Hanzō held Konan hostage and threw a kunai to Nagato, ordering him to kill Yahiko in order to save himself and Konan. As Nagato picked up the kunai and hesitated, Yahiko threw himself onto the blade, telling Nagato to protect Konan and that Nagato was the true saviour of the world. Satisfied that Yahiko was dead, Hanzō ordered his troops to kill Nagato and Konan as well.\nEnraged, Nagato summoned the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, using it to engulf the souls of Hanzō and Danzō's men and killing them, although at the cost of having black chakra receivers stabbed and embedded into his back, becoming permanently emaciated from the effort.",

  "description": "Nagato finishes telling Naruto his story, revealing that after Yahiko had died, he had scratched a horizontal line in his forehead protector and became the new leader of the Akatsuki. He then asks Naruto to give his answer to how the latter plans to achieve true peace. Naruto responds that he does not know how to achieve peace yet, but that someday he would break the curse of hatred in their shinobi world and that all he requires is the power to believe in it. Nagato is shocked at Naruto's words, recalling when he uttered those same words to Jiraiya, who was suffering from writer's block at the time. Pulling out Jiraiya's novel, The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi, Naruto explains that he plucked his words from the book itself, and that the protagonist's dialogue was exactly what Nagato had said to Jiraiya then. Naruto goes on to reveal that the character of the book is named Naruto, and that Jiraiya had bestowed that name upon him. Naruto adds that since he does not know how to write novels, his life would serve as the sequel to Jiraiya's book, and that he would act in the same manner as the book's Naruto did, in accordance with their master's principles, and that he would find the way to true peace.\nNagato claims that Jiraiya's ideology is outdated and asks Naruto how he could have faith in him if there are no guarantees that Naruto would not stray from his optimistic path once he experiences pain, the same way he did. Naruto tells Nagato that he has already experienced pain, having been shunned and ostracised from birth due to being a jinchuriki, and that his pain was worsened when he fought against and lost his friend Sasuke as well as when he hurt another friend. He explains that he still has a lot of pain buried deep within him and that he would never forgive Nagato for what he did, and that he does wish to kill him as a result. However, Naruto decides to stick Jiraiya's hope of the curse of hatred being broken and people understanding one another in true peace and harmony and promises Nagato that when he becomes Hokage, he would bring peace to Amegakure.\nTouched by Naruto's words, Nagato tells him that he reminds him of himself when he was younger, and adds that while he had joked that he and Naruto should be able to understand one another due to them sharing the same master, he truly understands Naruto's ideology. Deciding to put his faith in Naruto in the hopes that he truly can achieve peace, Nagato decides to use the last of chakra to use his Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to atone for his actions; Konan realises that Nagato would die as a result of using the Outer Path and is shocked that Nagato would give up his life in order to place his trust in the idealistic Naruto.\nBack at Mount Myōboku, Gamamaru tells Gamabunta that he never expected there to be two Children of the Prophecy and that he had never thought that Jiraiya's novel would play such a vital part in saving the world.",

  "description": "In the afterlife, Kakashi converses with his father, Sakumo, about how the latter chose to ignore the shinobi rules and save the lives of his comrades, despite knowing he would be condemned for it. He reveals that he felt bitter after his father committed suicide as a result of it, but tells Sakumo that he forgives his father for his actions and is even proud for saving the lives of his friends. At that same moment, Nagato uses his Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to resurrect those he had killed during his attack on Konoha, and Kakashi's soul begins to return to the land of the living. As he begins to fade, his father tells him that he can finally move on in peace with his son's forgiveness and see his wife.\nThe citizens of Konoha are perplexed as they see their fallen comrades come back to life, while Shikaku merely states that the event is proof that Naruto had succeeded in his talk with Pain. Nagato's hair becomes white and recalls when Jiraiya had saved the lives of the three Ame Orphans, taking care of them as he claimed it was the least he could do. Nagato tells Naruto that reviving the people he killed is the least he can do, and with his dying breath, places his faith in Naruto. Konan uses her Dance of the Shikigami ability to wrap the bodies of Nagato and the Deva Path, which she reveals is the corpse of their friend Yahiko. Konan tells Naruto that she is deserting the Akatsuki and is returning to Amegakure and that she, along with the village, are placing their hopes in Naruto as he now embodies both Nagato and Yahiko's dream. Producing a bouquet of roses, she hands it to him as she departs; Naruto places the bouquet, as well as Jiraiya's novel, at a make-shift memorial he makes for Jiraiya. As he begins to walk away, he nearly collapses, but is caught by Kakashi, who, along with the other villagers, had been debriefed on everything that had happened by Katsuyu, who had one of her bodies with Naruto the entire time. Kakashi thanks Naruto for his success and carries him back to the village, where Naruto is shocked to see all the citizens cheerfully welcoming him back.\nKakashi recalls how Naruto had told him that his dream was to be Hokage so the entire village would respect him and muses how Naruto has succeeded in doing so. Sakura arrives and bops Naruto on the head, although she hugs him and thanks him. Chōji and Shikamaru marvel in surprise that Naruto had actually defeated the Six Paths of Pain while Ino murmurs that she may actually be attracted to Naruto now; Kiba proudly declares to the villagers that Naruto was a classmate of his as Shino states that Naruto has outclassed them all. Meanwhile, Ebisu tells Konohamaru and Iruka that he had once viewed Naruto as nothing more than a nuisance, an extension of the Nine-Tailed Fox, and thus had kept him at arm's length, and adds that the other jōnin were against the Third Hokage's decision to accept Naruto as a genin. He recalls hearing how Naruto had defeated Zabuza, only for another villager to state that it was probably Kakashi who had done so, and how everyone was shocked when he was able to defeat Neji, a skilled member of the Hyūga clan, during the Chūnin Exams.\nAs Ebisu praises how Naruto has come far from then and how he had made the village finally accept him, Iruka thinks back upon how the villagers' opinions on Naruto began to change as word spread out that it was Naruto who defeated Gaara, the jinchūriki of Sunagakure, and how their perspective progressed when they heard that Naruto and Jiraiya were the ones who convinced Tsunade to become their new Hokage and how Naruto was the one who had rescued the Fifth Kazekage from the Akatsuki and had thus ensured an alliance between the two nations. Iruka remembers the Third Hokage notifying him that Naruto pulled pranks in order to force the villagers to acknowledge his existence and that the Fourth Hokage's dying wish was for Naruto to be seen as a hero someday; shedding tears, Iruka remarks to the Third and Fourth Hokage that there is a new hero among them as the villagers haul Naruto into the air.",

  "description": "As Iruka watches happily as Naruto is celebrated by Konoha, Zetsu, who had been observing Pain's assault from afar, decides to notify Tobi of Pain's death. At the same time, Team Samui begin their journey towards Konoha, having been sent on their mission by the Fourth Raikage. Iruka notices that most of the village has been destroyed but notices that there is a tree that it still intact, smiling as he fondly remembers when Naruto used to sit on the swing of that very same tree.\nIn the past, Naruto pulled many pranks on the village, including dumping a bucket of red paint on Hokage Rock, all as a plea for attention. Because the other teachers did not want him, the Third Hokage had personally summoned Iruka and asked him to be Naruto's teacher, which he reluctantly accepted. Iruka was warned by another teacher that Naruto was an attention-seeking troublemaker and that the key to dealing with him was to ignore him. During a ninjutsu practise session outside, Sasuke showed his mastery of the Clone Technique, which Naruto was unable to execute, thus causing Naruto to view Sasuke as his rival. As the classmates laughed at Naruto's failure, Iruka told them not to laugh at Naruto. While Naruto was initially overjoyed that someone was defending him, Iruka added that no one should pay any attention to Naruto, causing him to be saddened. Later that day, Naruto headed to the forest after class and attempted to master the Clone Technique, to no avail. He then passed by Ramen Ichiraku, where Teuchi offered him a free bowl of ramen on the house. The next day, after trying to beat Sasuke's proficiency in using shuriken, Naruto overheard two students murmuring that Sasuke's entire clan was killed and that he was the only survivor, which led Naruto to realise that Sasuke is an orphan as well.",

  "description": "After being denied a chance to join his classmates on a \"Test of Courage\", Naruto decides to pull a prank on them. Whilst browsing a selection of masks at a shop, he is forcefully pushed out the store by the shopkeeper, who proceeds to hurl a mask at Naruto's head, telling the boy to stay out. Hurt, Naruto picks up the mask, and runs away as he notices everyone on the street staring at him. Unbeknownst to him, Shikamaru and Chōji are also present, with the former wondering why Naruto is treated so badly.\nNaruto heads to the Konoha Cemetery wearing his mask and tricks Hibachi, one of his bullies. Iruka witnesses the frightened kids running and approaches the masked Naruto with a kunai. As Naruto takes his mask off, Iruka sheathes his kunai and recalls how he felt when his parents were killed by the Nine-Tailed Fox that is now sealed inside Naruto. Seeing the look on his sensei's face, Naruto asks how come everyone looks at him in that manner and runs away, vowing never to return to the Academy.\nThe following day, Iruka runs into Kakashi, who notices that his eyes are now lifeless. In the past, Kakashi was the squad leader on a mission Iruka was sent on, and the mission was endangered by Iruka's compassionate nature towards enemy shinobi. Deciding to use his compassion for good, Iruka asked the Third Hokage to have him appointed as an Academy instructor so that he could pass on the Will of Fire to the next generation. Kakashi remarks how Iruka's eyes held a spark that day, but that they are now dull. Iruka tells Kakashi that he cannot tolerate Naruto, albeit knowing that it is not Naruto's fault for housing a demon within him and that Naruto is just too troublesome to handle. However, Kakashi tells him that he is the only one who can touch Naruto's heart and adds that it would be Iruka's personal ordeal to do so. Later that evening, Iruka spots Naruto playing with kids on a playground. As the kids' parents come, a mother reprimands her child for playing with \"that kid\", something Iruka and Shikamaru both notice. As the kids and parents leave, Naruto grows sad at the fact that he has no parents to go home to and that the other parents do not like their kids playing with him. Later that night, Shikamaru asks his parents why people treat Naruto like the plague. Unable to tell Naruto the truth, Shikaku merely tells his son to ignore how the others treat Naruto and to treat Naruto in whatever way he wishes to treat him.\nThe next day, Hibachi tricks Naruto into heading to the back hills where enemy corpses are laid, promising to be his friend if he does so. Naruto, ecstatic at the prospect of finally having friends, rushes to the hills. In class, Iruka notices that Naruto is still absent and asks Hibachi if he had seen him, to which Hibachi lies and claims that he did not. Shikamaru, who had overheard Hibachi tricking Naruto, exposes Hibachi's prank to the class, and Iruka rushes out to intercept Naruto.",

  "description": "Iruka runs into the forest, recalling how he was told by a fellow teacher that there were still enemy spies in the area. He manages to find Naruto, and attempts to pressure him into returning to the Academy. Naruto tells Iruka that the latter could not possibly understand what his life is like, being isolated and treated like dirt and that he has to do this in order to finally have friends and be accepted. Iruka remains steadfast, prompting Naruto to use his Sexy Technique to distract Iruka as he escapes.\nNaruto, hungry, decides to raid a bird's nest when he finds an enemy's kunai. Unaware that the kunai has a secret intel report tied to it, Naruto attempts to return to the village, only to be ambushed by three kunoichi, who demand that he turn over the kunai. Not willing to give it up, Naruto flees, triggering various traps to delay the kunoichi. As he trips and falls over a cliff, he is found by Iruka, who picks him up and attempts to flee. The duo are saved by the arrival of Kakashi, who had been tipped off by Shikamaru, and he defeats the kunoichi with ease using his Lightning Cutter.\nBack in Konoha, the Third Hokage muses that the intel contained Konoha's patrol patterns and that by finding it, Naruto had inadvertently saved the village. Iruka thanks the Third for making him Naruto's teacher, claiming that he rediscovered his original passion for teaching and wishes to pass on the Will of Fire to students like Naruto. Outside the Academy, Iruka scolds Naruto for his reckless actions. When Iruka mentions that the Third Hokage is powerful and respected by all of the villagers, and that it was the Fourth Hokage who defended the village from the Nine-Tails, Naruto makes it his personal goal to become Hokage someday; hearing this, Iruka scratches a line into the tree with his kunai and tells Naruto that once he reaches that height, he might be able to become Hokage.\nIn the present day, Iruka smiles fondly at the mark as he realises that Naruto has reached that height. Yamato, who had been alerted that Naruto had entered into his eight-tailed form, rushes to the village and stares at its destruction. However, Shikaku tells him that it was Pain who had destroyed the village, and that Naruto single-handedly defeated him. Yamato is shocked that Naruto was able to do so, and is even more surprised when Shikaku tells him that Naruto was able to control his transformation on his own. At the same time, an Anbu member appears and tells Shikaku that there is an emergency council meeting being held and that his presence is requested.\nElsewhere, a resting Sasuke wonders where Suigetsu is. At that moment, Suigetsu show up through the door wielding his Kubikiribōchō, revealing that he had travelled all the way back to the Valley of Clouds and Lightning just to retrieve it. With Suigetsu's return, Sasuke mobilises Taka and notifies them that they are to head to Konoha right away. Meanwhile, Zetsu notifies Kisame and Tobi that Pain has been killed and that Konan has left as well. Tobi tasks Kisame with capturing the Eight-Tails while he, needing the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path to further their agenda, claims that he has something to attend to.",

  "description": "During an emergency council meeting with the Land of Fire, Koharu Utatane and Homura Mitokado of the Konoha Council are spurred on by Danzō Shimura to tell the Fire Daimyō that they need a new Hokage since not only is Tsunade in a comatose state, but because they hold her responsible for Pain's assault. Shikaku, knowing that Danzō is attempting to usurp Tsunade, rushes in to nominate Kakashi as Konoha's Sixth Hokage.\nThe Land of Fire is pleased with the choice, as Kakashi was the student of the Fourth Hokage, who was the student of Jiraiya, who in turn was the student of the Third Hokage. Feeling that Kakashi is the ideal choice, the daimyō nearly approves Kakashi's promotion until Danzō tells him that Kakashi, due to that exact chain, embodies the teachings of the Third, which are unwarranted and weaken their village. He adds that Tsunade's administration did nothing to prevent the rise of the Akatsuki nor did she officially mark Sasuke as a missing-nin, and therefore he should be the next Hokage. Convinced, the fire daimyō officially announces Danzō as Konoha's Sixth Hokage.\nMeanwhile, Sakura tells Naruto, Shizune and Kakashi that Tsunade may not awaken from her coma anytime soon, and that she had entered the comatose state due to healing all of the village's wounded. As Naruto and Sakura go off to fetch some water, Kakashi watches them and reminisces on when he was first assigned to their team.\nAfter being announced as the leader of Team 7, consisting of Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke, Kakashi observed them for the entire day, witnessing Naruto and Sasuke's kiss, Naruto ambushing Sasuke in order to spend some time with Sakura, as well as Naruto's trip to the bathroom due to spoiled milk. As he takes out his bells, he muses that they don't show much teammwork and that he cannot imagine that they would pass his bell test. Meanwhile, the two elders of the Konoha Council berate the Third Hokage for placing the Nine-Tails jinchuriki on a squad with Sasuke, claiming that Naruto should not be allowed outside the village. Unbeknownst to them, the meeting is spied by Danzō, who believes that the Third Hokage only did so due to the Sharingan's ability to control the Nine-Tails.\nIn the present day, Kakashi watches as Naruto and Sakura walk off into the distance and tells himself that it is up to him to stop Sasuke.",

  "description": "The villagers of Konoha begin their rebuilding process, with Yamato significantly expediting the restoration with his Wood Release: Serial Pillar Houses Technique. Naruto asks Sakura whether Tsunade would be alright, and Sakura consoles him, although she privately muses that she is the one who needs consoling. At that moment, the two are interrupted from their thoughts by old friends Inari and Tazuna, who have come from the Land of Waves to help rebuild Konoha. Inari remarks that Sakura has grown to be beautiful while reminiscing, along with Naruto, about the last time they met.\nAfter leaving the Land of Waves following the completion of their mission, Naruto realised that he he had lost his coupon for a free bowl of ramen at Ichiraku's and that he must have left it at Tazuna's house. As he rushed back to the village, Kakashi told Sasuke to bring him back as he and Sakura returned to Konoha. Meanwhile, Tazuna found the coupon and handed it over to Inari, who recognised it as Naruto's. Inari then set off to return the coupon to Naruto, only to be ambushed by Akane, Yamabuki and their friend, who proceeded to bully Inari for acting stuck up after defeating Gatō as Team 7 was no longer there to protect him. However, they had been overheard by Zōri and Waraji, two of Gatō's former henchmen, who had waited for Team 7 to leave so that they could continue their operations, and proceeded to kidnap the boys. At their hideout, Inari had helped his fellow peers escape and risked his own life so that they could return to the village. In the meantime, Naruto had run into Tazuna, who had told him that Inari had gone to return the coupon. Naruto found his coupon on the ground near the wood as Sasuke noticed that there tell-tale signs of a struggle. Naruto recognised the slash marks in the trees as the work of two thugs he had defeated earlier.\nAs the thugs cornered Inari, the boy jumped into the rapid river, only to be saved by Naruto, who had told him that the friends he helped escape had alerted him of the situation. Naruto then used his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to fight the thugs, with Sasuke helping defeat them using his Fūma Shuriken paired with his Shadow Shuriken Technique. As Tazuna and the other villagers showed up, the thugs gave up and were restrained; Inari thanked Naruto and the two cried tears of happiness, with Naruto crying even more when he realised he had lost his coupon once more.\nHaving finished their stroll down memory lane, Inari tells Naruto and Sakura that Akane and his friends are now carpenters just like him while Tazuna states that the Land of Waves would not have prospered if it wasn't for Naruto. As gratitude, Inari tells Naruto that the first thing he would build is a new Ramen Ichiraku just for Naruto, as Naruto had promised long ago that he would treat Inari to a bowl if Inari ever visited Konoha.",

  "description": "Tazuna begins to compliment Naruto for his actions and praising him as a hero, causing Sakura to recall back when Naruto was just an annoying child whose antics were troublesome, albeit fun.\nTeam 7 had been tasked with taking care of Condor, an ostrich. Sasuke had been displeased with the mission, claiming that had already done similar missions before, taking care of a cat and a dog. As they made their way towards a village, they noticed a vendetta occurring in the middle of the street between Tsukado and Katazu. Tsukada had been unable to kill Katazu, and thus Naruto had decided to coach him.\nWhen a gang leader named Kanabun had reorchestrated the fight, Naruto had realised that Katazu was not fighting back. Naruto proceeded to stop the fight, and the truth had come to light. Tsukado was commissioned by his family to kill Katazu as revenge for killing a distant relative of his; however, Katazu revealed that the struggle was between the relative and his twin brother and that the relative's death had been an accident. Because his brother had a wife and newborn child, he had decided to impersonate his brother and be killed on his behalf. The two agreed to stop their fighting, while Team 7 helped them defeated the incensed Kanabun and his gang.\nOn the way back to Konoha, Naruto remarked that revenge and vendettas were pointless, only to be shot down by Sasuke, who claimed that Naruto would never truly understand how important a vendetta could be. Having finished his reverie, the four are approached by Kakashi, who thanks Tazuna and Inari for coming to help. Tazuna asks about Sasuke's whereabouts, prompting Sakura to become sad while Kakashi flusters for an answer. Naruto decides to cover the two by claiming that he and Sasuke had a fight and that Sasuke left the village as a result, although he promises to retrieve Sasuke soon so that he may reunite with Tazuna and Inari; Sakura mentally thanks Naruto for dealing with the topic while Tazuna muses whether the three were stuck in a love triangle.\nAs the two carpenters walk away, Naruto tells Sakura and Kakashi that during his fight with Sasuke, Sasuke had told him that he would never understand the pain he was going through. Remembering that Pain had said the same thing, Naruto tells the two that he now truly understands what Sasuke was feeling that day, having felt the same feelings of revenge when Jiraiya was killed; he adds that someday, he would fight Sasuke again and bring him back home so that Team 7 could be together again.",

  "description": "Gaara consults with Kankurō and Temari about Konoha's destruction and whether they would be able to recover from the attack, especially with their Hokage being out of commission. Gaara tells them that Konoha would be alright as long as they had Naruto, prompting him to reminisce on the past.\nSometime after the Konoha Crush, when Suna decided to reaffirm their alliance with Konoha, the two nations decided to each send a shinobi squad to deal with bandits by their border. Team 7 had been assigned on Konoha's behalf while Suna dispatched Gaara, who had volunteered to join the forces in an effort to change his path, along with Korobi and Yaoki, who were terrified of their squad leader since he possessed Shukaku within him. Team 7 was shocked to see that they were to work alongside with Gaara and that he had seemingly mellowed out, with Sakura remembering when Gaara tried to kill her.\nBefore the two teams split up in their different directions, Gaara had notified Kakashi that the Suna Council had deployed their Anbu members to kill him during their mission. The Anbu managed to locate Gaara and trap him using their Water-Firing Puppets and nullifying most of his sand with the Puppet Water Release: Dance of Mystic Rain technique. Gaara warned Korobi and Yaoki to run away, and the two realised that Gaara had been looking out for them, and was not the monster that Suna believed him to be. Naruto, who had punched the Anbu earlier and tried to locate Gaara, berated the two for abandoning their friend. Naruto fought the Anbu using his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique while Korobi and Yaoki returned to help their friend, shocking Gaara. Gaara then proceeded to knock out the remaining Anbu members with his Sand Bullet.\nAs Kakashi arrived, Gaara told him and Naruto to let the Anbu be because they were his people, despite what they thought of him. The team then continued on their mission and successfully defeated the bandits. When the teams parted their ways, Korobi and Yaoki reaffirmed the fact that they viewed Gaara as their friend and Gaara smiled, finally having formed a bond with his people.\nAfter forming bonds with all of Suna's citizens and proving that he was more than just a monster, Gaara became the Kazekage. Crediting Naruto for his life changes, Gaara reminds his siblings that so long as Konoha had Naruto, they would prosper.",

  "description": "Sakura, Shizune, and Tonton are all sitting in a tent camped by Tsunade, who has remained in a comatose state since Pain's assault on Konoha. Chōji and Naruto arrive with lunch for them. As Naruto leaves to aid in the rebuilding of Ramen Ichiraku, Chōji and Shizune comment on his energetic personality and Chōji's quote leads Sakura to a flashback. She recalls the day when Naruto returned from a mission in an unknown village and appeared to be sick. Naruto sneezed on Sakura, who was about to depart on a mission. Later, after overeating at Ramen Ichiraku, Naruto was resting in his apartment when a group of Konoha medical-nin attempted to capture him. Throughout the episode Naruto eluded the medical team and other characters who had been ordered by Tsunade to capture him.\nAfter interrogating a medical-nin, Naruto learns that his capture was under Tsunade's orders as she believes that he is the carrier of a rare and dangerous chakra virus that affects a person's ability to mould chakra. Since the village was still recovering from the Konoha Crush, Tsunade did not want anything to cripple the village. After Naruto was eventually captured and sent to Konoha Hospital it was discovered that he was never infected. Naruto, infuriated at Tsunade's actions, demanded an apology. Tsunade merely said that it was an emergency drill and thanked Naruto for co-operating. Naruto remained angry at her and exploded in a fury of rage as Sakura ends the flashback. She then notes that Chōji's quote, \"Fools never catch a cold\", may be true in Naruto's case, but that he certainly knows how to stir things up.",

Instead of giving them the weapons, he showed them useless weapons he made. While out on a snack, Team Guy, under Tenten's command, returned to find Iō missing.

Meanwhile, two thugs, Gameru and Kusune, have come to take all of Iō's weapons. They are wielding Dakō and Tsurukame, two of Iō's prototype weapons, and with them they easily overpower Naruto's and Neji. However, Tenten was able to beat them using Iō's latest weapon, Jidanda. After the battle, Tenten asked to keep Jidanda, only to be refused by Iō, who wished to improve upon it.\nNeji snaps Tenten out of her flashback as the two cross the bridge towards the research facility, with Tenten wondering whether Iō had perfected the Jidanda.",

As a result, Tsunade dispatched a team consisting of Naruto, Shino, Lee, and team captain Kotetsu to retrieve him from the Zeroth Training Ground. When they spotted Condor, Shino attempted to capture him, but his bugs were all eaten by insect-eating plants. After Lee lost to a boxing kangaroo and Kotetsu and Naruto were unable to defeat Condor, the squad decided to retreat.

In what he perceived to be his dying moments, Kotetsu thought only of his partner, Izumo, and how they dreamt of becoming jōnin together.

  "description": "Lee visits Tsunade's tent and gives Sakura a special medicine that Guy had prepared for her, citing that he would do anything to help the comatose Hokage as it was she who healed Lee when no one else could; Lee and Sakura reminisce back to when Lee was severely injured and had difficulty recuperating.\nAfter Naruto carelessly drank the last of Lee's special medicine, he vowed to go to retrieve the Jofuku Flowers needed to make the medicine. Despite being assigned to a mission with Ino and Sakura, Naruto decided to abandon the mission and find the flowers instead. Dressing up in the green jumpsuit that Guy had given him, Naruto set off towards the Jofuku Forest, only to discover that his assigned mission was coincidentally to go that very forest and deliver a message to a woman who lives there.\nAs they began their journey, Sakura mused how Lee had lost his optimism and Ino berated Naruto for giving him false hope that he may successfully recover. Naruto responded that ever since he witnessed Lee trying to continue his fight with Gaara despite losing consciousness, he knew Lee never gave up, and thus he would always give Lee hope that he would someday recover. As they made their way to the forest, Naruto located the Jofuku flower, which Ino was surprised glowed in different colours. After making a jab at Ino for not knowing about the flower despite being a florist, Naruto plucked the flower, only to be attacked by an apparition of Gaara. Naruto channelled his inner taijutsu and emulated Lee's moves, but his blows were blocked by the apparition's Sand Armour. Resorting to ninjutsu, Naruto used his Naruto Uzumaki Combo to defeat the apparition and finished it off with his Rasengan, destroying it.\nFurofuki, the woman who lived by the forest, accepted the letter the team was assigned to deliver, which was a request from Guy to haul back the Jofuku flowers to Konoha (revealing that Naruto's self-appointed quest was the very mission he was assigned); she also explained that the Gaara they saw was a protective element emitted by the flowers, which took on the image of the archenemy of whomever plucked the flower. Back in the village, Guy told Lee that the medicine he made was made from the sweat, tears and love of himself and the three who procured the ingredients. After discovering that Sakura was on the team, he stated that he would eat a hundred per day since Sakura's love was infused in the medicine, while Guy performed a thousand push-ups as moral support.",

Jiraiya advises that Naruto train solely to fight off the Akatsuki and that he would be a fool to chase Sasuke, but Naruto declares proudly that he is a fool. As Naruto recovers, the two set off on their journey.\nElsewhere, Jiraiya attempts to teach Naruto how to break out of a genjutsu illusion, since Sasuke would most likely be learning how to master genjutsu using his Sharingan. As Naruto practises all night, Jiraiya recalls how he told Naruto that he bore a striking resemblance to the Fourth Hokage and thinks back upon Naruto's parents, Minato and Kushina. The next day, Jiraiya summons Gamariki to inflict his Genjutsu Kiss on Naruto, advising Naruto to rotate his chakra from within in order to disturb his chakra flow, thus breaking out of the genjutsu. Instead, Naruto rotates his chakra externally and hits Gamariki.\nIn order to hone Naruto's skills, Jiraiya and Naruto head to the Genjutsu Tree Village, where the trees give off a magnetic field that induces genjutsu. However, they discover that the entire village has been taken over by Kandachi, who is keeping the women and children hostage after killing Sukune, the village's former leader. In order to defeat Kandachi, Naruto transforms into Tanishi, the child who had notified them of the village's crisis, and ties up Jiraiya, pretending that he had caught Jiraiya as his prisoner. The two are then escorted to the lake, where Kandachi resides and where the prisoners are held.",

Jiraiya recognises Kandachi as the right hand man of Hanzō, the ruler of Amegakure, and asks what Kandachi is doing taking over the Genjutsu Tree Village. Declaring that Ame has no ruler, Kandachi prepares to thank Tanishi for bringing him Jiraiya, only for the real Tanishi to show up. Naruto undoes his Transformation Technique, and believing that Tanishi was an accomplice, Kandachi decides to kill the hostages, including Tanishi's mother.\nKandachi summons the Conch King to devour the hostages, but Jiraiya manages to sever the ropes holding the hostages in their cages with his Fire Release: Flame Bullet. With the hostages rescued, Naruto attempts to strike the Conch King with his Rasengan, only to fail as the Conch King's defensive shell is able to withstand its impact. Naruto is whipped repeatedly with the Conch Whip, prompting Tanishi to remember how his father was killed in the same fashion and how he viewed his father and Naruto for being fools for defying Kandachi. Jiraiya and Naruto are placed under the Conch King's Water Release Genjutsu: Demonic Phantom Fog Prison, which neither of them are able to break out of naturally. However, Tanishi, deciding to be a fool like Naruto, frees them with his Chilli Pepper Bombs, which are able to dissipate the effects of genjutsu.\nJiraiya restrains Kandachi and the Conch King with his Needle Jizō while Naruto continues to form his Rasengan until it grows into a Big Ball Rasengan, which he uses to defeat the Conch King and knock out Kandachi. With Kandachi and his goons defeated, the village is restored back under the villagers' control. As Naruto and Jiraiya leave the village, Jiraiya reminisces how Naruto reminds him of his father, Minato. An apparition of Minato tells Jiraiya that since he had viewed Jiraiya as his father, Naruto would be a grandson to him. Jiraiya proclaims out loud that Naruto is his grandson and attempts to hug him, only for Naruto to be disturbed by his affection and push him away.",

  "description": "Nekobaa is visited by a cat, who sees a photo of Team 7 and makes remarks about Sasuke. In the past, Nekobaa had hired Team 7 (minus Kakashi) to collect a pawprint from Nekomata, the ruler of the ninja cat underworld. Because this was originally a mission Itachi had bequeathed to Sasuke to test his strength, Sasuke decided to complete it to prove that he could surpass Itachi's expectations.\nAs they visited Nekobaa, Sasuke was infuriated by the mention of Itachi's name. Nekobaa explained to Naruto and Sakura that Itachi had tasked Sasuke with capturing feline paw prints before, which she compiled into a Paw Encyclopaedia. The three genin were assigned to break into Nekomata's fortress to acquire his pawprint and were given Cat Ears to not only deceive other cats into thinking that they were cats as well, but to be able to understand cat speech as well. As Naruto lost his cat ears, Sasuke and Sakura sneaked in undetected and split up to cover more ground. Sasuke easily defeated all of Nekomata's bodyguards and made his way to face the ninja cat, who placed Sasuke within a genjutsu. Using his Sharingan, Sasuke managed to break out of the genjutsu and dodged most of Nekomata's attacks. As Nekomata was about to crush Sasuke, he was saved by the arrival of Naruto and Sakura. However, Sasuke told them that this was his mission and that he did not need help. Revealing that he had placed explosive tags around the ceiling, Sasuke detonated the tags and buried Nekomata under rubble, acquiring his pawprint.\nNekobaa muses how cute Sasuke was then, while the cat she is talking to is revealed to be none other than Nekomata, who was asked years earlier by Itachi himself to fight Sasuke when the time came. As Nekomata glances at a photo of Sasuke and Itachi gathering their pawprints, she remarks how they used to be so close to one another.",

  "description": "As Konoha begins to rebuild itself following Pain's assault, an old man named Kosuke Maruboshi looks up at Hokage Rock and remembers a time when he had a mission with Naruto.\nAfter the Konoha Crush, a captain named Hayama had recruited Tekuno, a jōnin, and two genin, Naruto and Kosuke, to patrol the border of the Land of Fire and fend off intruders who were attempting to strike at the crippled Konoha. Despite Kosuke having been a genin for more than fifty years, he proved himself useful in cooking and detecting enemies. He revealed that he had been on missions with the Second Hokage, the Third Hokage, Jiraiya, and Sakumo, all of whom eventually surpassed him and went on to achieve great fame.\nIwagakure shinobi were the ones by the border, and they proceeded to attack the four-man team. Hayama dealt with them using his Vacuum Sword while Tekuno stalled them with his explosive tags; Naruto attempted to keep them at bay with his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, but failed. As Naruto was nearly killed by an Iwa-nin, Kosuke used his Leaf-Style Willow technique to kill the enemy and saved Naruto. Naruto pondered as to how Kosuke knew a technique that was not genin level, while Kosuke merely retorted that Naruto's Shadow Clone Technique was also not a genin technique. Kosuke mused on his past, on how he had sacrificed his comrades in an attempt to attain chūnin status and how in shame he had decided to be a genin forever, despite the Third's insistence that he become a jōnin. He was snapped out of his reverie by incoming enemies, and told Naruto to notify the village while he dealt with the others.\nKosuke was eventually cornered by an Iwa Kunoichi, whose Earth Release: Underground Split was blocked by Kosuke's Water Release: Water Formation Wall technique. He was outraged to discover that she had purposely sacrificed genin as she believed that was the genin's duty, while she was shocked to discover that Kosuke and Naruto were just mere genin. The kunoichi planned to dismember Kosuke as a result, only to be stopped in her tracks by Naruto, who told Kosuke that he would not allow a comrade to die as he would become Hokage one day. Kosuke was reminded of the Fourth Hokage once telling him the same thing while bandaging his leg, and resolved to prove to the Iwa kunoichi that Konoha-nin would not give up. Using his Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique, he countered her Earth Release: Earth and Stone Dragon and defeated her, while reflecting on how Naruto was like his father.\nKosuke smiles at Hokage Rock as he finishes with his recollection while Tekuno shares the same tale with the other villagers, trying to convince them that it was a real story and that he did in fact go on a mission with Naruto, Konoha's new hero. Kosuke looks at Minato's face on the monument and mentally remarks how Minato should be proud of his son.",

  "description": "While Konohagakure is being rebuilt, Kakashi notices a travelling musician, which causes him to flashback to a incident with his team. Kakashi remembers seeing a woman, disguised as a travelling performer, at the gate into Konoha. The woman, Hanare, was actually a spy for the Jōmae Village, and was taken in for interrogation with Ibiki. Fruitless with his results, Ibiki went to find Inoichi who was able to get into her mind and find out all that she found out about Konoha and Jōmae Village, but Hanare used her technique against him, to find out all that he knows about Konoha. Since Inoichi found a memory of a young Kakashi, he went to find him. When Kakashi and Hanare stop to look at the clouds after taking a walk, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, who were eavesdropping on the conversation, fell out of a tree, causing Kakashi to fall on top of Hanare, making them accidentally kiss. Knowing about Hanare's assumed lack of any information on Konoha, the Third Hokage assigns the ninja team to go rescue Riichi from the Jōmae ninja, in exchange for Hanare. The exchange happened at the centre of the bridge, but when Riichi was on Konoha's side of the bridge, Kakashi blew the bridge up, unwilling to let Hanare go. Hanare ran away, with Kakashi in pursuit, until they reached a cliff, where Hanare said that she wanted to die by Kakashi's hands, and that she already removed all that she had learned about Konoha from her mind. He told her that he would never kill a ninja that had lost their honour, and told her to leave. As Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura found them, Kakashi claims that Hanare jumped off the cliff. She was later shown walking where she first met Kakashi many years ago.",

  "description": "Konohamaru, Udon and Moegi interview Neji about a story related to Naruto for the Academy newspaper, and Neji acquiesces. During the final rounds of the Chūnin Exams, Sunagakure and Otogakure teamed up in an effort to destroy Konohagakure. Neji was told by his grandfather that two Kumo Spectators decided to take advantage of the chaos by using the opportunity to kidnap Hinata, all in a bid to acquire the Byakugan. Tenten and Kiba joined Neji as well, Kiba not trusting Neji to actually save Hinata since Neji was known for looking down on her.\nAfter triggering a trap that produced mud wolves, Tenten stayed back to deal with them while Neji and Kiba went ahead. After locating Hinata and the Kumo shinobi, Kiba and Akamaru used their Passing Fang to interfere; Kiba picked up Hinata and dropped a Smoke Bomb before disappearing. As the Kumo shinobi chased Kiba and Hinata, Kiba turned around and used Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on one of them, knocking him out. Kiba was actually Neji, who had used the Transformation Technique. Sekiei, the remaining Kumo-nin, used his Earth Release: Earth Flow Wave to avoid being struck by Neji's Gentle Fist and attempted to finish him off with his Violent Heavenly Earth Needle technique; however, his attack was blocked by Hiashi's Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven.\nHiashi told Neji that he had left the village despite what was going on because both Hinata and Neji were precious to him. Team Ebisu is surprised to hear the story, unaware that such a crisis had happened during the Konoha Crush. Neji divulges that sometime after, the two Kumo-nin were apprehended and the situation was dealt internally with Kumogakure to avoid a conflict. The three genin pester Neji to explain what Naruto had to do with the story, and Neji tells them that if Naruto hadn't changed his perspective on life and destiny during their fight, then he may not have agreed to go save Hinata. However, they are unsatisfied with the story and Neji tells them to go ask somebody else for a story about Naruto.",

  "description": "When asked by Shikamaru and Shiho to see if he recognises anyone in the photos they were able to recover, Naruto grabs one and leaves. He then thinks back to how he met the man in the photo. He remembers a time when he found a tag with the name Kisuke written on it. When Naruto is sitting in his bed, he sees a man sitting on the other side, and after realising he is a \"ghost\", he starts screaming. Naruto asks him who he is, but the man does not remember. After seeing a tulip in Konoha, he suddenly remembers who he is and how he became to be a ghost. He was an Anbu operative investigating infiltration of spies into Konoha. His main suspect was Sabiru. After following him around, he was discovered, and the two clashed. The battle ended with Sabiru sealing away Kisuke's soul and Kisuke's body being left in a river. Naruto (disguised as Kisuke) breaks into a meeting involving Konoha's security system and accuses Sabiru of being a spy. When Sabiru says that the real Kisuke is dead, Naruto escapes with Kakashi and Sabiru in pursuit. At some point in the chase, Kakashi caught Naruto, and gave Naruto a chance to prove Sabiru guilty of the murders of Kisuke and his wife. When Sabiru confessed to Naruto that he did kill the two, Kakashi appeared, ready to arrest him, but was promptly taken out by a hidden Kabuto Yakushi. At the end of the day, Kisuke's soul is ready to depart and says goodbye to Naruto. In the present, Naruto places a bouquet of tulips on the gravestone of Kisuke, just as he promised him he would do whenever he remembers him.",

Sakura commented on how Naruto and Sasuke were inseparable when they were younger and Naruto suddenly remembers the early days when they were on a mission to retrieve a golden statue, which was stolen by a band of thieves from a daimyō's sister. As Naruto and Sasuke retrieve the statue, Sakura gets taken hostage. At first, Sasuke insists on continuing the mission, but Naruto reminds him that Kakashi said those who abandon their friends are worse than scum. When they finally find Sakura and the bandits, it was at first hard for them because their hands were stuck together. However, the two learned how to fight as a team and they quickly defeated the bandits and their leader, Jako. Although their mission was a success, the statue itself was very damaged, though Kakashi suggested that it could be melted down and re-casted. When Naruto complained about his hand being stuck to Sasuke's, Sakura said that it will crumble and fall apart within two or three days, much to the two's disappointment, as Naruto had to go \"number two\". Sasuke was aghast at the idea, only for Naruto to reply that it was fine since they already peed together, much to Sakura's shock. Meanwhile, Kakashi was content that the two embodied the shinobi principle of never leaving a comrade behind.",

  "description": "On the way to Konoha, Taka briefly stop at a place which Sasuke remembers from his past.\nRecalling how Naruto summoned Gamabunta during his fight with Gaara, Sasuke was frustrated at Naruto's spike in strength. After destroying a tree with his Chidori, he noticed a small girl named Naho who was about to fall off a cliff towards her death and promptly saved her. Because Sasuke did not know that she was a relative of the Fire Daimyō, he did not treat her with the respect she was used to, causing her to become infatuated with him.\nNaho was later sent to Konoha where Tsunade appointed Naruto and Sakura as her bodyguards while Sasuke and Kakashi were on a mission of their own. Because Naho explicitly wanted Sasuke, Naruto used the Transformation Technique to disguise himself as Sasuke. The trio were soon ambushed by a bandit named Sadai, who wanted to kidnap Naho for money. Using his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, Naruto attempted to dazzle Naho by using his \"Sasuke Punch\" and \"Sasuke Kick\" to take out the bandits and tried to defeat Sadai with his Naruto Uzumaki Combo, which he refined into the Lion Combo since he was impersonating Sasuke. However, Sadai was unfazed by the attack, prompting Naruto to strike him with Rasengan, only to be shocked that it did not work as well.\nMeanwhile, Sasuke and Kakashi discovered that their mission, which was to apprehend wanted criminals in the Land of Fire, were planning to kidnap a girl named Naho, whom Sasuke recognised. As Sadai defeated Naruto, the transformation technique dispelled and Naho was shocked to see that it was not Sasuke. As she cried for Sasuke, the latter arrived. Sadai noticed his Sharingan and mused how he had met Itachi and how he had thought that Itachi had killed the entire Uchiha clan, and theorised that Sasuke must not have been worth killing. Incensed due to the fact that Itachi had said those same words, Sasuke destroyed Sadai's armour with his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique and struck him in mid-air with his Chidori. As Naho watched in horror, Sasuke began to beat the man to inches of his life, with Sadai's blood splattered on Sasuke's face. Sadai was saved by the arrival of Kakashi, and Sasuke decided to return to Konoha. Naho became scared of Sasuke; however, she was comforted by Naruto, who told her that Sasuke was going through some problems and that he was usually a nice guy, and that he would take her to meet him once he calmed down.",

  "description": "Using his ink mice, Sai locates Kabuto hiding out in one of Orochimaru's old hideouts. Before he can go in, Tokuma Hyūga and his squad arrive, notifying captain Anko that Sai was to return to Konoha immediately while they take his place in the Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party. Anko asks what happened, due to the fact that Yamato had left abruptly and stated it was an emergency. Tokuma reveals that the Akatsuki mounted an attack on the village and that it was destroyed, and that due to Tsunade's coma, Danzō had been appointed Hokage.\nMeanwhile, Team Samui make their way to Konoha, surprised at its destruction. Samui takes the Fourth Raikage's letter to Tsunade, only to discover that Tsunade is in a coma. She demands to see the acting Hokage, and Danzō enters the tent and proclaim himself as the village's Sixth Hokage. The letter requests that the village take action on missing-nin Sasuke Uchiha and to hand over all intel gathered on him. Danzō agrees, and passes down an official order to eliminate Sasuke.\nSai is told by Danzō to keep an eye on Naruto, whom he promises not to harm at the moment due to the fact that Naruto is viewed as the village's hero. Kiba finds Naruto, Sakura and Kakashi, who are about to leave the village, and relays what has transpired. Naruto and Sakura attempt to extract information from Sai regarding Danzō, but Sai reveals that he has a cursed seal on his tongue that prevents him from doing so. He tells the duo that all members of Root are branded with the seal to eradicate any attempts of interrogation should they be captured. Naruto asks Sai why Danzō has called out for Sasuke's assassination, which shocks Sai since he was not made aware of the fact.\nThe mention of Sasuke's name has the trio held at sword point by Karui and Omoi, who stuns them by revealing that Sasuke kidnapped their master and is a member of the Akatsuki. As Sakura begins to cry, the two Kumo-nin berate them for not being able to understand what it feels like to know that their master may have been killed. Recalling how he felt when Jiraiya died, Naruto asks whether their master is a jinchūriki, much to their shock. Naruto tells them that the Akatsuki capture jinchūriki alive and therefore their master is not dead yet, and notifies them that he is a jinchūriki as well. He agrees to help them look for their master, and Karui accepts his offer, asking him to debrief them about Sasuke on the way.\nElsewhere, Taka continue on their path towards Konoha, only to be blocked by Madara. Sasuke tells Madara that Taka has left the Akatsuki, but Madara explains that they blundered in their attempt to catch the Eight-Tails and thus must make amends. His associate, Zetsu, appears and notifies Madara that Danzō has been made Hokage, much to Sasuke's indignation, since Danzō was one of Konoha's elders who forced Itachi to massacre his own clan. Madara reveals that Konoha had been destroyed by Pain while Zetsu notifies the group that a Five Kage Summit has been called.",

  "description": "Naruto is held against a wall by Karui, who attempts to force him into giving up information regarding Sasuke. Naruto tells her that if he does sell out his friend, then they would succeed in finding and killing Sasuke, forcing Sasuke's friends from Konoha to kill them; Kumo would retaliate, thereby giving birth to another cycle of hatred. In order to defuse Kamui's hatred, Naruto offers himself as a punching bag. Naruto is severely beaten, but is saved by Sai, who blocks Karui's punch. Karui's teammate Omoi also restrains her, telling her that Naruto is the type to never give up or sell out his comrades, a quality which he likes. Samui arrives and whisks her team away, notifying them that they have intel on Sasuke to decipher. Naruto asks if he may tag along as well in order to meet the Raikage, but Samui tells him that the Raikage is too busy and on the move to meet him.\nElsewhere, Zetsu notifies Madara and Taka that it was Naruto who defeated Pain, citing that Naruto may be stronger than Sasuke now. Sasuke smirks, and tells Taka that their new objective is to head to the Five Kage Summit to kill Danzō. Madara approves the plan, and Zetsu splits himself into two — Black Zetsu and White Zetsu. White Zetsu leads Taka to the summit's location while Black Zetsu stays back with Madara. Madara muses how he never expected Nagato to use the Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to revive all those he had killed during his assault and that Naruto has severely affected their plans.\nIn the makeshift Hokage office, Danzō orders his Root faction to find Kabuto and kill him before Anko does, since Kabuto is aware of Danzō's association with Orochimaru. He commands Root not to kill Anko but to make sure to extract the human experimentation files that Kabuto possesses, claiming that it would be useful for his bandaged eye and arm. He tasks the remaining members to watch over Naruto, telling them that the Nine-Tails is not allowed to leave the village, and assigns the two highest-ranking members, Torune Aburame and Fū Yamanaka, as his personal bodyguards for the summit.\nWhile he is recovering in his tent, Naruto tells Kakashi and Yamato that he wishes to find the Raikage and convince him to forgive Sasuke. Yamato replies that Naruto, as a jinchūriki, is not allowed to leave the village, especially since the First Hokage's Necklace has been destroyed, as well as the fact that Naruto entered into his eight-tailed form during his fight with Pain. Naruto reveals that he met the Fourth Hokage and that it was he who suppressed the transformation. He adds that the Fourth told him that the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack sixteen years ago was orchestrated by the masked man who leads the Akatsuki, who the Fourth believed was manipulating Pain. Naruto tells him that he cannot allow Sasuke to be manipulated in the same fashion and that he must save Sasuke. Kakashi theorises that the Fourth must have infused a part of his mind into the seal with his Dead Demon Consuming Seal technique, and that the masked man must be Madara Uchiha. Remembering how he met his father in the afterlife, who was waiting just to speak to him, Kakashi asks Naruto if the Fourth ever said anything to him, since fathers usually have something to say to their sons. Naruto smiles and proclaims that his father told him that he believed in him.\nHe also asks Sai to notify Danzō about Madara being the mastermind over the Nine-Tails' attack as well as the fact that Madara is the Akatsuki's true leader. Despite the fact that Konoha is not allowed to dispatch any shinobi to allied nations during the Five Kage Summit, Kakashi decides to bend the rules, placing his trust in his sensei's faith in Naruto. He notifies Naruto that he and Yamato, whom he calls Tenzō, are going to be Naruto's escorts for his journey to Kumogakure.",

  "description": "Gaara sets off for the Five Kage Summit in the Land of Iron, with Kankurō and Temari as his bodyguards, as the other allied nations prepare to do the same. After receiving word that Team Samui is to meet him at a rendezvous point on the way to the summit, the Fourth Raikage begins his journey, with C and Darui as his bodyguards. In Kirigakure, the Fifth Mizukage prepares to leave as well, with Chōjūrō, a former member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, and Ao, a hardened veteran of the old \"blood mist\" Kiri, as her personal guards. At the same time, Ōnoki, the Third Tsuchikage, heads for the summit as well, carried by his subordinate Akatsuchi; his granddaughter Kurotsuchi tags along as one of his retainers as well.\nIn Konoha, Kakashi tasks Yamato to find a way to track the Raikage. Using his Transmission Wood, he embeds tracking seeds in the heels of Team Samui as they too head off towards the Land of Iron. Kakashi asks Sai to notify Danzo that nothing is going on with Naruto and that he is still in the village. Sai is aware that Kakashi does not trust him completely, which Kakashi justifies by citing that he is one of Danzo's men after all. However, Kakashi reminds Sai that he is a member of his team and thus believes in him to do the right thing. Since Danzo did not trust Sai completely, he had assigned two Root guards to watch over Naruto. As Naruto and Konohamaru test out their Sexy Technique, the two guards lean in, only for Kakashi to block their view and use his Genjutsu: Sharingan on them. Naruto tells Konohamaru that he heard he had taken down one of Pain's bodies with his Rasengan, and congratulates Konohamaru for being a hero. He promises Konohamaru that when he returns from his mission, he would teach him the Big Ball Rasengan, and Kakashi smiles proudly.\nWith the guards placed under a genjutsu, Kakashi, Naruto and Yamato set off to tail Team Samui. Meanwhile, Taka, led by White Zetsu, make their way to the Land of Iron in order to kill Danzo. On his way to the summit, Danzo is attacked by the Prajñā Group, but he removes his bandaged right eye to reveal a Sharingan, which he uses along with his Wind Release: Vacuum Wave to eliminate the clan. Danzo also receives Sai's message through an ink bird, and simply states to Torune and Fū that it was a routine report.\nC tells the Fourth Raikage that he senses Team Samui, and they descend in order to reconvene. However, C abruptly notifies Samui that they had been tailed, and orders their pursuers to come out. Naruto, Kakashi and Yamato emerge from their hiding spot, and Naruto declares that he wishes to speak with the Raikage.",

  "description": "Naruto tries to convince the Fourth Raikage to veto the execution order on Sasuke Uchiha, claiming that Sasuke is his friend and that killing him would pit Konoha in a war against Kumogakure. As Naruto gets on his knees and begs, Yamato reminds him that Kumo owes them for the Byakugan incident, in which Hinata was kidnapped by a Kumo-nin under the Raikage's orders and Hizashi Hyūga had to be sacrificed as a result. However, the Raikage merely dictates that shinobi should be powerful and headstrong, instead of bowing their head and begging. Stating that the Akatsuki are criminals that deserve to be hunted, the Raikage and his squad continue on the way to the Five Kage Summit.\nOnce all five Kage convene at the Land of Iron, they begin their discourse, where the Raikage declares that he does not trust any of the other Kage because they have used the Akatsuki as mercenaries in the past, shocking Gaara. He explains to Gaara that while Orochimaru may not have been a member during the Konoha Crush, he did kill both the Third Hokage and the Fourth Kazekage, and that Iwagakure and Kirigakure have often enlisted the Akatsuki's services, with rumours swirling that Kiri is home to the Akatsuki. The Third Tsuchikage explains that in a time of disarmament where suspicious between shinobi nations still persist, it is cheaper and much more effective to hire the Akatsuki to fight for them and that he had no regrets or qualms about it, while the Fifth Mizukage reveals that Yagura Karatachi, the Fourth Mizukage, had actually been controlled by a member of the Akatsuki.\nGaara discloses to the other leaders that he was once a jinchūriki, and that the former Fifth Hokage of Konoha was the only one to provide any assistance. The Third Tsuchikage justifies their lack of involvement by citing that the abduction of jinchūriki is an embarrassing matter that should be dealt privately and internally, and that despite the Akatsuki's collection of tailed beasts, not even the jinchūriki can fully control them, citing Gaara as an example. However, Danzō divulges that there have been people who have managed to gain full control over the tailed beasts, namely Hashirama Senju, Madara Uchiha, Yagura, the former Mizukage, and Killer B, the Raikage's brother. To the utter shock of the other leaders, he reveals that Madara himself is the leader of the Akatsuki.\nWith Madara being announced as the leader, the other Kage realise the seriousness of the situation and the action that must follow. Mifune, the general of the Land of Iron, declares himself the presiding neutral party and proposes that all five hidden villages convene as one to form the Allied Shinobi Forces as a response to the Akatsuki threat, and that Danzō, the leader of the village that houses the last remaining jinchūriki, should be the leader of the allied forces.",

  "description": "After hearing that Danzō has been chosen as the leader of the Allied Shinobi Forces, Sasuke and his team head out, slipping by the samurai guards. The Fourth Raikage demands to know why Danzō was chosen and not him, since Kumogakure has yet to produce any shinobi that are members of the Akatsuki. Mifune, the general of the Land of Iron, explains that the Raikage is unsuitable for leadership due to giving in to his emotions often. Gaara is too young to assume leadership of five allied nations despite the title of Kazekage; adversely, the Third Tsuchikage is too old, and he is also not an ideal candidate due to the fact that he has employed the services of the Akatsuki numerous times in the past. Since the Akatsuki is rumoured to have been conceived in Kirigakure, the Fifth Mizukage is not qualified to lead without possible suspicions arising, thus leaving Danzō, the Sixth Hokage, to be the favorable choice.\nMeanwhile, Ino begins to cry after hearing about the execution order placed on Sasuke. Shikamaru, assuming command of the remaining members of the Konoha 11, goes to Sakura's tent to talk to her when he hears the conversation occurring inside. Sai approaches Sakura and asks her how she and Naruto can fight for Sasuke so much when he does nothing but cause them pain, and that despite his lack of understanding over emotions, he feels anger over their pain. He asks Sakura what promise Naruto made to her, prompting Sakura to gasp and remember the promise Naruto made to her about bringing Sasuke back no matter what, even when he had failed. Sai reveals that Naruto is in love with her, and Sakura realises that she has been causing Naruto the same pain that Sasuke had been causing her. Shikamaru enters the tent and explains that he and the others would be heading out to eliminate Sasuke and would like Team 7's approval, citing that failing to do so would start a war between Kumogakure and Konohagakure. After he warns Sakura that he would need to complete this mission with or without her blessing, Shikamaru is aghast to discover that Naruto has already gone to the Land of Iron to meet the Raikage. To his surprise, Sakura agrees to it and find Naruto, explaining that she would like to take the opportunity to break the news to Naruto to atone for the suffering she caused him.\nBack at the summit, Ao uses his Byakugan and discovers that Mifune is being manipulated by Shisui Uchiha's genjutsu, which is being cast by Danzō. He interrupts the summit, asking Danzō to reveal his right eye. When questioned, he explains his suspicions and how he was able to deduce the genjutsu with his Byakugan, which he took as a trophy of war from a fallen Hyūga. He tells the other kage that Danzō is in possession of Shisui's eye and is casting Shisui's genjutsu to obtain leadership of the Allied Forces, and that the genjutsu is so powerful that the victim is not even aware that they are being influenced. However, the summit is then crashed by White Zetsu, who notifies them that Sasuke is somewhere in the building.\nElsewhere, Naruto prepares to go to sleep, musing about how Sasuke has been consumed by vengeance and wonders why Sasuke won't return home now that he has killed Itachi and succeeded in his quest for revenge. His thoughts are then interrupted by the arrival of Tobi, who tells Naruto that it is time for the two to converse.",

  "description": "Naruto attempts to attack Tobi with his Rasengan, only for the attack to go through him. Yamato restrains Tobi with his Wood Release while Kakashi prepares his Lightning Cutter, telling Tobi that he knows that he is none other than Madara Uchiha. Madara reiterates that physical attacks won't work on him; however, Yamato reminds him that he would have to become tangible if he ever wishes to capture Naruto, and that he would strike when such an opportunity arises. Madara states that he has only come to talk to Naruto, wanting to know how he convinced Nagato to betray him. Naruto, however, is only interested in wanting to know about Sasuke. Madara agrees to explain Sasuke's motives, but adds that to do so, he must first tell them the truth about Itachi.\nBack at the summit, the Fourth Raikage breaks White Zetsu's neck, seemingly killing him. He is admonished by the Fifth Mizukage for killing off a valuable source of information, but brushes it off as he and his two subordinates, C and Darui, decide to locate Sasuke and kill him. Before leaving, he tasks Ao to keep Danzō under watch, who meekly explains that he cannot use his technique multiple times a day. Mifune berates him for his actions, claiming that he may have actually chosen Danzō to be the leader of the Allied Shinobi Forces, but Danzō explains that there is no time for morality and ethics in their shinobi world if they wish to produce results. Gaara, Kankurō, Temari, and Kurotsuchi decide to leave in order to find Sasuke as well.\nMeanwhile, Sasuke engages in combat against the samurai soldiers, easily killing them. Suigetsu notices the change in Sasuke's behaviour, as Sasuke had previously been vocal about only killing when necessary, while Karin is able to sense the change in Sasuke's chakra, stating it to be more ominous than the second stage of his cursed seal. The Fourth Raikage, C, and Darui join the battle, with the Raikage activating his Lightning Release Chakra Mode. Darui uses his Lightning Release: Wave of Inspiration to keep Sasuke at bay while the Raikage rushes forward to attack Sasuke, only for the blow to be blocked by Jūgo. C uses his Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to induce a bright genjutsu, but Sasuke dispels it with his Sharingan. However, both Darui and the Raikage use the opportunity to launch an attack; Suigetsu joins the fray and uses his Kubikiribōchō to block Darui's Cleaver Sword, while Jūgo bears the brunt of the Raikage's Elbow.\nSuigetsu's blade is broken from the clash and continues to fight Darui, who orders C to locate Karin. Using her Chakra Suppression Technique, Karin is able to hide, while Sasuke paralyses C with his Genjutsu: Sharingan to take him out. Jūgo, who had purposely tapped into his homicidal nature and had entered into full Sage Transformation, tries to kill the Raikage with his Multiple Lotus Nonself Connected Cannons, only for the kage to survive unscathed. With Jūgo being injured, Sasuke decides to face the Raikage himself.",

  "description": "Madara finishes sharing the truth about Itachi to Kakashi, Yamato and Naruto, who don't believe him. Madara tells them that what he has told them is true and that while he did consider Sasuke returning to Konoha to carry out Itachi's will, Sasuke has decided to wreak vengeance upon the village. Naruto blames Madara for manipulating Sasuke, but Madara replies that Sasuke made his decision under his own volition and that Sasuke, like him, possesses the Curse of Hatred.\nHe explains that the Sage of Six Paths, who possessed the Rinnegan, had two sons. The elder son believed that peace would come only through power and strength whereas the younger son believed that peace would be achieved through love. On his deathbed, the Sage chose his younger son as his successor, infuriating the eldest son; the two brothers eventually clashed. As time passed, their descendants also fought, the elder son's descendants being the Uchiha clan and the younger son's descendants being the Senju clan. The Uchiha clan possessed the elder son's Curse of Hatred while the Senju clan had the younger's Will of Fire. Madara tells them that a battle between both descendants is inevitable, and that just as he fought Hashirama Senju, Naruto and Sasuke, the new incarnation of the descendants, would clash as well. Kakashi asks what Madara and Sasuke's common goal of validating the Uchiha clan has to do with the collection of tailed beasts, but Madara merely replies that it is a tale for another time and disappears.\nBack at the Five Kage Summit, Sasuke engages in combat with the Fourth Raikage. Sasuke's Chidori manages to make contact with the Fourth's torso, despite the latter being cloaked in his Lightning Release Chakra Mode. The Raikage praises Sasuke, telling him that he is impressed and that Sasuke's technique is similar to Kakashi's. He then proceeds to use his esteemed taijutsu and attacks Sasuke with his Liger Bomb, a technique that no one has supposedly survived. Darui manages to impale Suigetsu, whose Hydrification Technique is affected by the Lightning Release running through the blade. Darui goes on to help C to his feet as they observe in shock as Sasuke survives the strike.\nSasuke is revealed to have formed a partial Susanoo to shield him from the Liger Bomb, although the ribs of the Susanoo have been snapped. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke attempts to burn the Raikage with his Amaterasu, only to burn the samurai standing behind him. The Raikage rushes towards Sasuke in order to attack him through the Susanoo, but Sasuke uses his left eye to manipulate the black flames to shield the Susanoo, causing the Raikage's left arm to burn. Despite the flames, the Raikage decides to finish off the exhausted Sasuke with his Guillotine Drop, while the latter shields himself with his Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi, shaping the black flames to protect him.\nAs the battle is stopped abruptly by Gaara, who uses his sand to negate both Sasuke and the Raikage's attacks, C notices that Sasuke's proficiency with the Amaterasu surpasses Itachi's, while also realising the trick behind Sasuke's eyes. The Raikage cuts off his burned left arm and has C heal it while Temari and Kankurō remove the Amaterasu-ridden samurai armour off the soldier. Gaara attempts to convince Sasuke to shed the darkness and return to the light; with his eyes bleeding from using the Mangekyō, Sasuke merely states that what he wants exists only in darkness. Having no choice but to eliminate him, the Three Sand Siblings, along with Darui, decide to finish the job. Darui fires his Storm Release: Laser Circus while Kankurō, revealed to have obtained the Sasori puppet, unleashes his Red Secret Technique: Machinery Triangles; Temari employs her Wind Release: Great Sickle Weasel Technique as Gaara tops it off with his Successive Shots Sand Drizzle. However, all four of their attacks are blocked by Sasuke's Susanoo, which has now fully formed, and the latter proudly declares it as the ultimate defence for those who possess the Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes.\nMeanwhile, Karin is able to locate Danzō, but her tracking is noticed by Fū, who alerts Danzō. Danzō tells him to wait until their enemies reach the stronghold, at which point they would escape amidst the chaos. Their conversation is overheard by Ao, who tells them that he is a Sensor Type as well and that they would not be fleeing if the enemies should attack. Hearing this, the Third Tsuchikage amusingly states that the summit is finally getting interesting.",

  "description": "At the decimated Valley of Clouds and Lightning, Killer B emerges from the watery depths and tells the Eight-Tails about his plan to learn enka from Sabu, leader of the enka ninja. The Eight-Tails asks why Killer B brought forth his power when he could already had the upper hand, while Killer B merely remarks that Sasuke of the Sharingan is one of the toughest foes he's ever fought. Meanwhile, Kakashi asks Naruto and Yamato not to reveal the truth about Itachi to anyone in the event that it was nothing but a lie.\nBack at the Five Kage Summit, Sasuke destroys the pillars, causing the roof to collapse. Using his Susanoo, he saves himself and Karin, whom he only spared so that she could lead him to Danzō. Gaara shields himself, his siblings and Darui while the Fourth Raikage uses his massive strength to punch his way out of the rubble. Suigetsu and Jūgo survive as well, with the latter using his Cellular Regeneration Absorption to escape from the brink of death. Karin leads Sasuke to the conference room, where Sasuke is engaged in combat with Mifune. During the struggle, Danzō, Fū and Torune escape.\nThe Fifth Mizukage uses her Lava Release: Melting Apparition Technique and repels Sasuke along with his Susanoo out of the room. She reveals that she possesses two kekkei genkai — Lava Release and Boil Release. Using her Boil Release: Skilled Mist Technique to create corrosive acid, she dissolves the chakra surrounding Sasuke's Susanoo and prepares to kill him, as the latter does not have any chakra left to defend himself. However, she is suddenly restrained by White Zetsu's Spore Technique. Using the spores, White Zetsu absorbs some chakra from the Fifth Mizukage, the Third Tsuchikage, Chōjūrō and Akatsuchi, passing them on to Sasuke. As Sasuke storms into the kage conference room, he is trapped by the Tsuchikage's Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique, which seemingly incinerates him into mere particles. The Tsuchikage smirks and tells Karin that she is next while the Raikage, who had just stormed into the room, berates him for stealing his kill. At that moment, Tobi warps into the room carrying the unconscious Sasuke, announcing himself as Madara Uchiha and asks them if they would like to hear about his Eye of the Moon Plan.",

  "description": "As the Five Kage Summit comes to a close, Mifune decides to appoint A, the Fourth Raikage, as the leader of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Gaara and the Fifth Mizukage do not protest the decision, and shortly after, the Third Tsuchikage decides to acquiesce. They decide to tell their respective daimyō about the Fourth Shinobi World War that has been launched as well as the news regarding their alliance. Gaara heads out to find Naruto and Kakashi, whom A tells him are still in the Land of Iron, while A himself leaves with C and Darui to find his brother, Killer B. Kurotsuchi secretly suggests that Iwagakure kill B and Naruto, in order to remove two essential pieces from Madara's plan, while crippling the military power of Konoha and Kumo simultaneously. However, to her surprise, the Tsuchikage tells her that Gaara had reminded him of who he used to be and thus he does not wish to resort to sneaky, conniving tactics and instead intends to cooperate with the other nations.\nElsewhere, Sakura professes her love for Naruto, shocking Yamato and Lee. She tells Naruto that she has grown to love him and has given up on Sasuke, who is nothing but a mere criminal who has joined the Akatsuki. Recalling how Sakura had told him that she was desperate for Sasuke's love, how she cried when she thought Sasuke was dead, and how she tearfully asked him to bring Sasuke back home, Naruto realises that Sakura is lying to him and admonishes her for her sense of humour. Sakura attempts to convince him that she truly does love him, citing that she, along with the villagers, stopped viewing him as a mischievous annoyance when he became their hero after defeating Pain. Naruto hisses that he hates people who lie to themselves and forcefully tells her to stop. Irritated, Sakura states that he cannot tell her how she feels and that he does not need to honour the promise between them anymore and that he should give up on Sasuke. Naruto attempts to tell them the truth behind Itachi to justify Sasuke's actions, but is stopped by Kakashi. Naruto merely states that he understands Sasuke's pain now and that he is making it his personal ambition to save his friend. Defeated, Sakura walks away, ordering Kiba, Sai and Lee to follow her back to the village; however, once of earshot, she asks Kiba to track Sasuke down for her. Unbeknownst to Sakura, Sai creates an ink clone that he leaves behind with Naruto, Yamato, and Kakashi.\nMeanwhile, Killer B attempts to train in enka with Sabu, but their session is crashed by Kisame, who had been sent to retrieve the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki. B infuses his Lightning Release chakra into his pencil as well as his Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords, but Kisame's sword Samehada devours the chakra, rendering the attacks useless. Transforming into his four-tailed form, B headbutts Kisame, but the latter is unaffected by it.",

  "description": "Danzō and his two guards: Torune and Fū Yamanaka, make their way out of the Land of Iron when the latter is able to sense Ao tailing them. Danzō orders Fū to retrieve Ao's Byakugan at all costs. Using his Mind Puppet Switch Cursed Seal Technique, Fū transfers his consciousness into a puppet he leaves lying in a tree, which he rigs to attack Ao in order to use it as a medium to perform his Mind Body Switch Technique on the Kiri-nin. With Ao's consciousness confined to the puppet, Fū attempts to extract the Byakugan with a kunai, but Ao's talisman earrings form a barrier around the eye. Ao tells Fū that only he and certain Kiri-nin can undo the barrier seal. Undeterred, Fū decides to decapitate \"himself\" on the blade of the sword, cancelling his Mind Body Switch technique at the last second, as his original body is given the same injuries as his host body.\nAs he jumps off a tree and prepares to slice Ao's head off, he is saved by the Fifth Mizukage. \"Ao\" tells her that he was under the enemy's Mind Body Switch technique and apologises for being careless. The Mizukage offers to undo the barrier seal, and \"Ao\" thanks her. At that moment, the Mizukage tightens the ropes on Ao's hands and tells Chōjūrō to hand her his Hiramekarei. She reveals that she knows Ao is still under the technique, as he would have never apologised in front of Chōjūrō along with the fact that Ao is aware that she was incapable of removing the seal around his eye. Fū insults her and dispels the technique causing the enraged Mizukage to attack the actual Ao. Back in his original body, which is being carried by Torune, Fū seeks Danzō's forgiveness for failing his mission.\nMeanwhile, Killer B is engaged in combat with Kisame. Killer B goes into his Version 1 seven-tailed form and rushes towards Kisame, but the latter merely uses his Samehada to devour the tailed beast chakra, causing B to lose six of his tails. The Eight-Tails asks B to unleash his power, but B reminds him that Sabu and Ponta are in the vicinity. He then enters into his Version 2 state and hits Kisame with his Lightning Release: Lariat. Although he manages to severely wound Kisame, Kisame's blade once again devours his chakra, instantly reverting Killer B into his Version 1 four-tailed form. Siphoning the chakra his blade stole, Kisame uses it to heal the injuries sustained from the Lariat. He muses that he is known as the tailless tailed beast and proceeds to utilise his Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave to create a giant water dome.\nKisame fuses himself with the Samehada, sprouting gills and furthering his shark-like appearance. As the Eight-Tails realises that the dome moves in conjunction with Kisame's movements, the beast suggests that Killer B move in the opposite direction as Sabu and Ponta. Kisame manages to trick B into thinking he would be killing the two comrades; as B swims to protect them, Kisame restrains him. Killer B enters into a partial transformation, morphing the lower half of his body into octopus tentacles to bind Kisame. B manages to get loose as Kisame drains his chakra and shoots out ink to cover his tracks, although Kisame is able to sense his chakra and attacks him until B's chakra is at its lowest. Bursting the dome of water, Kisame prepares to cut off B's legs to prevent him from running away. However, the Samehada blade grows a liking to Killer B's chakra and refuses to sever his legs, instead choosing to transfer back the chakra it stole. In anger, Kisame kicks the blade away and picks up one of B's Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords. Before he can use it to cut off B's legs, the Fourth Raikage, C, and Darui intervene, having spotted the water dome. Using their Lightning Release: Double Lariat, Killer B and the Raikage decapitate Kisame, whose detached head amusingly remarks how fast the two are. The Raikage then berates Killer B for running away from Kumogakure.",

  "description": "Jūgo and Suigetsu attempt to flee the hideout disguised as samurai, but are instantly discovered. Sai's ink clone notifies Kakashi, Naruto and Yamato that the other members of the Konoha 11 have decided to kill Sasuke themselves in order to prevent a war from spreading. Naruto does not believe that Sakura would have consented to it, since she is in love with him. However, Sai responds that it is because she loves him that she has agreed to eliminate him, and adds his personal conjecture that he believes that she is planning to kill him herself, much to Naruto's shock. Sai tells Naruto that the only reason Sakura \"confessed\" was to alleviate Naruto from the promise he made, but when Naruto was steadfast in his decision to save Sasuke regardless, she could not bring herself to tell him of their plan to terminate him. He also adds that the reason Sakura is doing all of this is because of what Sai said to Sakura back in Konoha, unintentionally guilt-tripping her into doing this. Naruto's mind is overwhelmed and he almost breaks down, but at that moment the Three Sand Siblings arrive, claiming that they have urgent news to relay.\nMadara encounters Danzō on the Samurai Bridge, who commands his two subordinates Fū and Torune to deal with Madara until he can remove his Sealing Arm Braces. Using his intangibility, Madara is able to evade all of Fū and Torune's attacks, including the former's Mind Body Switch Technique. Realising that Madara must manifest physically in order to strike back, Fū rushes at him. He goes right through Madara, who turns back and forms a fist. Seeing this, Torune, who had removed his shirt, unleashes his rinkaichū. However, Madara had tricked them into thinking he would manifest and Torune's attack hits Fū instead. As Torune heals Fū, Madara realises that Fū and Torune are from Konoha's Yamanaka clan and Aburame clan, and compliments Danzō for his choice in subordinates. He then uses Kamui to transport Fū and Torune elsewhere, and proceeds to disappear himself.\nMeanwhile, Gaara, Temari, and Kankurō relay the events that transpired at the Five Kage Summit to the three, and notify Kakashi that he is being considered as the Sixth Hokage candidate due to Danzō's actions. Yamato declares that such a decision would need approval from the village elders, but Temari replies that Suna would form their immediate response to the upcoming Fourth Shinobi World War as if Kakashi was Hokage. Gaara tells Naruto that if he is to ever become a Kage someday, he would have to learn to do what was best. He adds that before he met Naruto, he did not know what the word 'friend' meant, and that he considers Naruto to be his friend. Before leaving, he asks Naruto to think of what the word friend means to him before deciding on what to do about Sasuke.\nIn Kamui's Dimension, Karin finishes healing Sasuke just as Madara phases in front of her. He tells Sasuke that he has a present for him and warps the three of them back to the bridge, where Danzō awaits. Madara tells Karin to step away, warning her that she would be killed if she interfered. Danzō removes the bandages on his arm, revealing numerous Sharingan implants, and states that he is about to add Sasuke and Madara's eyes to his collection.",

  "description": "Kakashi asks Sai's ink clone to direct him to where Sakura is in order to prevent her from trying to kill Sasuke, since she is not strong enough to fight him. Naruto, overwhelmed with everything he had just heard, hyperventilates and passes out.\nOn the Samurai Bridge, Danzō removes the bandages on his right arm to reveal ten Sharingan eyes embedded on it. Sasuke demands to know how he obtained those, but remarks that whatever response Danzō gives would simply infuriate him further and that it does not matter since he would kill Danzō regardless. Danzō rushes forward in a burst of speed to attack Sasuke, but the attack is blocked by the latter's Susanoo. Trapped within the Susanoo's grip, Sasuke asks whether Danzō had really ordered Itachi to slaughter his own clan. When Danzō remarks that he never pegged Itachi as the type to divulge secrets before dying, Sasuke accepts it as acknowledgement and crushes Danzō, seemingly killing him.\nHowever, Danzō reappears right behind Sasuke, and attempts to stab him with a kunai, only for the Susanoo to shield him once more. As Danzō jumps high into the air, Sasuke ascends into the Susanoo's head and incinerates Danzō with his Amaterasu. Despite being burned to ashes, Danzō appears unscathed in front of Sasuke, although Karin notices that every time Danzō survives what seems like a fatal injury, a Sharingan eye on his arm seals itself shut.\nDanzō uses his Wind Release: Vacuum Sphere to fire wind bullets at Sasuke. Sasuke's flesh is slightly pierced as he moves to evade being mortally wounded by the attack, although he ends up falling off the bridge. Using the blood from his wound, Sasuke summons Garuda, a giant hawk, to prevent his fall. Danzō infuses his Wind Release with his shuriken to create lethan fan blades, and fires the projectiles towards Sasuke. Using his Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke is able to evade the smaller shuriken while using his sword to catch one of the Fūma Shuriken and repel the second one into the sky, where it is caught by Garuda. Sasuke then lunges towards Danzō, but Danzō manages to clutch his throat. At that moment, Garuda swoops in and uses the spinning shuriken to slice off Danzō's Sharingan-embedded arm, allowing Sasuke to stab him.\nWhile the battle seems momentarily won, Danzō and his severed arm fade out of existence and rematerialise on top of a pillar. Sasuke then glares at him as he induces a genjutsu, splitting his body into a mob of crows that reemerges next to Danzō, taking on the form of Itachi.",

  "description": "Danzō comes face-to-face with \"Itachi\" as Sasuke attempts to impale him from behind. However, Sasuke is paralysed at the last second while Danzō muses that Sasuke's genjutsu pales in comparison to Itachi's proficiency with the Tsukuyomi. A cursed seal begins to spread throughout Sasuke's body and Madara realises that Danzō must have applied it when he grabbed Sasuke's throat earlier. Danzō, prying Sasuke's sword out of his hands, muses that leaving him alive was Itachi's greatest mistake and remarks why Itachi would have done such a thing. Recalling how Madara had told him how Itachi was unable to kill him because he thought Sasuke's life was precious, Sasuke manages to manifest a full Susanoo transformation, the resulting chakra eradicating the cursed seal.\nDanzō jumps down the ground and uses his Wind Release: Vacuum Great Sphere to expel a sphere of compressed wind, although it is unable to take out the Susanoo. Sasuke fashions a bow out of his Susanoo and fires an arrow at Danzō. Despite being impaled, Danzō disappears and rematerialises next to the arrow. Madara is shocked to see that Danzō is employing a secret kinjutsu of the Uchiha clan known as Izanagi, which is a powerful genjutsu capable of blurring the lines between reality and illusion and thus can grant its user the ability to avoid being killed. Sasuke fires another arrow at Danzō, who is forced to sprout a tree from his right shoulder to shield himself. Karin wonders why Danzō did not simply use his \"immortality\" technique to avoid the attack like he had been doing all along, noticing that using the tree significantly decreased his chakra levels. Meanwhile, Madara realises that Danzō's ability to use Wood Release means that Danzō had been transplanted with Hashirama Senju's cells by Orochimaru, and that the Senju cells allows him to wield multiple Sharingan eyes and to use Izanagi despite not being of Uchiha blood; additionally, possessing the First Hokage's Wood Release in conjunction with the Uchiha's Sharingan would grant Danzō the ability to control a tailed beast, notably the Nine-Tailed Fox, and thus realises that obtaining Naruto is one of Danzō's goals.\nDespite bleeding out of his eye, Sasuke strains himself to fire another arrow, yet Danzō simply uses Izanagi once more to negate its effects. Noticing that Madara is keenly observing the battle and fearful that he may soon join the fray, Danzō decides to summon Baku, a tapir. Using its powerful inhalation, Baku attempts to draw in Sasuke and his Susanoo. Danzō appears behind Sasuke and bombards him with his Wind Release: Vacuum Serial Waves, which are augmented by Baku's power, to force the Susanoo towards the tapir. Sasuke takes advantage of Baku's inhalation by unleashing his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, which Baku immediately ingests; in pain, it dispels itself out of the battle. As Danzō attempts to strike Sasuke from behind, his attack having caused a weak spot in Susanoo's rear armour, Sasuke turns around and has the Susanoo punch Danzō, who uses Izanagi once more to survive unharmed.\nKarin observes that another Sharingan eye has shut itself on Danzō's right arm. She counts the ten eyes and notices that there are only five left and realises that once the remaining five are sealed shut, Danzō would not be able to evade fatal injuries anymore. She attempts to relay her findings to Sasuke, but he merely tells her that he had already caught on earlier and thus had been forcing Danzō the entire time to continue relying on Izanagi until he used up all ten eyes. Infuriated, Danzō uses Wind Waves to attack the oncoming Susanoo; while he does not destroy it, he is able to block it. However, Danzō is punched by the Susanoo once more and uses his seventh eye to utilise Izanagi again. Manifesting himself behind Sasuke, whose Susanoo has faded away, Danzō throws kunai towards him, although Sasuke uses his bracelets to produce shuriken, which he throws back. Unable to evade it in mid-air, Danzō employs Izanagi to elude it, leaving him with only two Sharingan eyes on his right arm. As Sasuke forms his Chidori Sharp Spear, he asks Danzō how many Uchihas' had to die in order for him to gain ten Sharingan eyes; Danzo, using his Wind Release: Vacuum Blade to transform his kunai into a sword, replies that he could not have done it without Itachi. The two then lunge towards one another, clashing their blades.",

  "description": "Sasuke and Danzō are stabbed by each other's Chidori Sharp Spear and Wind Release: Vacuum Blade respectively. Danzō remarks that Sasuke is foolish to think he could win and attempts to use his Izanagi to reverse his injuries. However, to his shock, he is unable to use it and notices that all ten Sharingan eyes on his right arm have been sealed shut. Madara realises that Sasuke had been using genjutsu to subtly make Danzō believe that his Izanagi time had slightly increased; thus, Danzō used what he believed were just eight out of the ten eyes when in reality he had exhausted all of them.\nPulling away from the Chidori Sharp Spear, Danzō's right shoulder begins to grow uncontrollably. As a tree begins to emerge, Danzō slices off his right arm completely, while Madara theorises that Danzō was unable to suppress Hashirama Senju's cells or control the Wood Release with his chakra levels being so low. Danzō removes the bandages around his head to reveal another Sharingan eye in his right eye socket, which Madara recognises as Shisui Uchiha's, the one capable of using Kotoamatsukami. Madara wonders whether Danzō would use Kotoamatsukami or Izanagi against Sasuke, although Danzō, knowing that Izanagi would render the Sharingan useless and wanting to save Kotoamatsukami to control Madara, decides to simply take Karin hostage, using her as a human shield. Karin begs Sasuke to save her while Danzō remarks that he must resort to such tactics in order to survive and strengthen the shinobi world, and that Karin would just be a means to reach that end. Sasuke tells Karin not to move; as she smiles, thinking he would save her, Sasuke pierces them both with his Chidori Sharp Spear, striking one of Danzō's vital spots.\nDanzō proceeds to hop across the Samurai Bridge, desperate to survive, as Sasuke merely walks behind him, smirking. Madara arrives to block Danzō's path and notifies him that he would be taking Shisui's eye now. Sasuke gasps as he recalls when Itachi was suspected of murdering his best friend Shisui and is shocked to know that Shisui's Sharingan was taken by Danzō. Meanwhile, Danzō recalls memories of the First Shinobi World War, in which he was placed in an Escort Unit consisting of Team Tobirama, Kagami Uchiha, Torifu Akimichi, and himself. He had been saved from near death by his teammate and rival Hiruzen Sarutobi, which irked him. As they were being pursued by twenty Kumo-nin, the team realised that one of them had to stay back to give the others time to escape, sacrificing their life in the process. Danzō considered offering himself up, but hesitated, due to his strong desire to live. Hiruzen offered to be the lure, earning Danzō's vexation, who protested against Hiruzen's attempts to outstage him. The team's leader, Tobirama Senju, who was the Second Hokage, berated Danzō for always competing against Hiruzen instead of working together as a team and decided to be the one who stayed back himself, as he was the oldest and wanted the younger generation to live a lengthier life. Before departing on his suicide mission, he bestowed the title of the Third Hokage to Hiruzen, telling his student to pass down the Will of Fire and to take good care of the village.\nDanzō tells himself that just like Hiruzen had sacrificed himself to save the village, it was time he did the same too, and decides to take Madara and Sasuke with him to the afterlife for what he perceives as the welfare of Konoha. Using his Reverse Four Symbols Sealing technique, Danzō unleashes a black sphere with the objective of drawing and sealing Madara and Sasuke's soul into his body; however, Sasuke and Madara manage to get out of the sphere's radius. As he dies, Danzō thinks back on his rivalry with Hiruzen and wonders what Hiruzen would have thought of his actions, while musing that no matter what he did, he was unable to become Hokage like he'd always wanted.",

She asks Kiba where Sasuke's exact position is before trying to drop sleep bombs on the others. Sai manages to restrain her arms, having anticipated her plan, and alerts the team that he had tipped off Kakashi, who was on their way to stop them from trying to kill Sasuke. Kiba suspects Sai of being duplicitous and tries to attack him with Passing Fang, only for Sai to create ink snakes to bind him. Sakura goads Lee into attacking Sai as well, and uses the chance to throw her three sleep bombs at everyone else, knocking them out. On the way there, Sai's ink clone alerts Kakashi of Sakura's actions before dissipating.\nOn route towards the bridge, Sakura thinks back upon when she first fell in love with Sasuke at a young age and how pleased she was to be placed on Team 7 with him, as it gave her chances to stare at his face many times. However, she admits to herself that she never knew the kind of person he was on the inside, recalling how Sasuke was bit by Orochimaru in the Forest of Death and used the power given to him by the Cursed Seal of Heaven to break Zaku's arms before she was able to stop him from attacking Dosu. Knowing that the cursed seal caused him immense pain, she told Sasuke that the thought of seeing him in pain was unbearable to her, although he merely brushed her off. She recalls how, in order to validate his strength, he had challenged Naruto to a fight and how the two formed their respective Rasengan and Chidori at one another, only for their attacks to be dispelled by Kakashi, who berated Sasuke for trying to kill Naruto. Shortly after, Sasuke had decided to desert Konoha in order to gain power from Orochimaru. Despite telling him how much she loved him and how happy she could make him, even offering to come with him to help him gain revenge, he merely told her that she was annoying and that he was not like her, as he was an avenger.\nAs the memories linger on her mind, Sakura steels in her resolve to be the one to eliminate Sasuke. Back at the bridge, Madara and Sasuke look at the damage caused by Danzō's Reverse Four Symbols Sealing technique. Using Kamui to warp away Danzō's body and proclaiming that Shisui's Sharingan would be his, Madara warns Sasuke to get some rest before heading to Konoha, reminding him that his eyes would go blind by continually overusing the Mangekyō Sharingan. He adds that Sasuke should finish off Karin if she holds no further use to him, as she knows too much. As Madara warps away and Sasuke approaches Karin, she remembers how he had used his Lion Combo to save her from a bear during the Chūnin Exams and how he had smiled at her, and longs to see that smile once more. However, Sasuke merely activates his Chidori and prepares to end her life, only to be stopped by Sakura, who declares that she has deserted Konoha and wishes to join him.",

  "description": "Naruto recalls his fight with Sasuke at the Valley of the End, where Sasuke told him that they were best friends and that he would fight to sever that bond with Naruto. Naruto wakes up, realising he was dreaming about the past. He notices Yamato watching intently over him and decides to go back to sleep again, reminiscing on his past memories regarding Sasuke. He remembers when Sasuke had beaten him in shurikenjutsu and how he considered Sasuke his rival from that point on, and when he found out Sasuke's entire clan had been wiped out. After Sasuke was placed on Team 7 with him, Naruto trained solely to catch up to Sasuke, remembering how the two competed against one another to master the Tree Climbing Practice in the Land of Waves.\nHowever, he also thinks back to when Sasuke had told them that his goal was to restore his clan and destroy a certain someone, whom Naruto later learned was his brother Itachi, and remembers when the two fought. At the Valley of the End, Sasuke had told him that he would never understand the pain and suffering he was going through since he was all alone from the beginning and how he wanted to sever the bond between him and Naruto, and how he had finally managed to reunite with Sasuke after three years, only for Sasuke to remain steadfast and tell Sai that the only bond he had was the bond of hatred he had with Itachi. Recalling how Pain told him that he would never comprehend pain to the extent needed to save Sasuke and how Kabuto told him Sasuke was a changed man as well as when Jiraiya told him to give up on Sasuke, Naruto reflects on how Jiraiya was his family and how he felt after Jiraiya was killed, and realises for the first time how Sasuke truly felt when his family was murdered.\nSince Yamato was under orders to bring Naruto back to Konoha while Kakashi found Sasuke and Sakura, Naruto hides himself under the covers and uses his kunai to create a secret hole, disappearing through it while leaving a shadow clone behind to fool Yamato. Entering into his Sage Mode, Naruto locates Kakashi's chakra signature and heads to the Samurai Bridge, reflecting on Gaara's advice about doing the right thing when it comes to Sasuke. Naruto muses that he would know the right thing to do once he encounters Sasuke.",

  "description": "Kakashi finds the unconscious Kiba, Akamaru, Lee, and Sai in a wooded path and manages to briefly render Kiba conscious long enough to find out where Sakura had gone. At the Samurai Bridge, Sakura tells Sasuke that she has defected from Konoha and wishes to join him. Sasuke alerts her that his goal is to destroy Konoha and that if she still wishes to join him, she must kill Karin, claiming she'd be a perfect replacement as she is a medic-nin as well. Sakura pulls out a kunai and walks up to Karin but hesitates to kill her. Sasuke, in turn, forms a Chidori in his left hand and prepares to kill Sakura from behind, only for the attack to be blocked by Kakashi, who realises in shock that Sasuke had intended to murder her and exclaims how far Sasuke had fallen.\nKakashi tells Sakura to take Karin elsewhere and to heal her since she possesses a lot of information on their enemies while, as their teacher and the one responsible for letting the situation come to a head the way it had, he deals with Sasuke. Kakashi recalls when he used to wonder how the Third Hokage still had a soft spot for Orochimaru despite everything Orochimaru had done and how the Hokage had no choice but to fight his former student to the death, and finally comes to understand himself how the Third felt. Sasuke summons shuriken from his bracelets and throws them towards Kakashi, who blocks it with his Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall. Sasuke leaps over the wall and prepares to finish off Kakashi with his Chidori Sharp Spear, but Kakashi jumps off the bridge to evade the attack.\nSasuke praises Kakashi's usage of his Sharingan, albeit insulted that a non-Uchiha is using it. He notifies Kakashi that only a true member of the Uchiha clan can use it effectively, and forms his Susanoo. Sasuke has the Susanoo fire an arrow at Kakashi, who uses Kamui to warp the arrow away. Sasuke is impressed that Kakashi was able to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan and attempts to use the Susanoo once more, only for his vision to become blurred; as a result, his Susanoo and his Sharingan deactivate. Kakashi attempts to convince Sasuke to change his ways, repeating what he once told Sasuke about how revenge does not get anyone anywhere; Sasuke retorts that Kakashi should stop talking as if he was his sensei and exclaims that he would only stop his tirade if Kakashi could bring his father, mother, and brother back to him. Sakura, who has finished healing Karin, sneaks up behind Sasuke, recalling her memories of Sasuke, back when they had passed the bell test as well as her conversation with Sasuke before he defected from Konoha. She holds a kunai to his back, finding herself unable to kill him. Sasuke turns around and grabs her throat with one hand while prying the kunai out with the other. Kakashi, weakened by the Mangekyō, is unable to stop him as Sasuke attempts to kill Sakura, only for Naruto to arrive in the nick of time and whisk Sakura out of harm's way.",

  "description": "Kakashi praises Naruto's timely appearance while Sakura realises in shock that Sasuke truly meant to kill her. Naruto attempts to convince Sasuke to turn back on his quest, claiming he would be there to save Sasuke no matter what. Sasuke smirks and replies that he doesn't need rescuing, and that he wants nothing more than to destroy Konoha for the way they treated the Uchiha clan and to snuff out of the villagers from whom he hears nothing but laughter and condescension. Naruto notifies Sasuke that he knows the truth about Itachi, having been told by Tobi, and that he understands exactly what Sasuke wants to do, stunning Kakashi and Sakura.\nSasuke reminds Naruto that as he had no parents or siblings, he could never understand how he feels. Wanting nothing more than vengeance, he declares that he has already killed Danzō, a village elder responsible for the Uchiha Clan Downfall, and that he can feel his clan's name being purified. Kakashi is shocked to discover that Sasuke killed Danzō all on his own, and realises that Sasuke has changed from his student on Team 7 and that he is a by-product of the cycle of hatred perpetuated in the shinobi world. Sasuke forms his Chidori and begins to approach them, while Naruto creates two shadow clones in response. Kakashi, however, bars Naruto and his clones from engaging in combat, telling him to take Sakura and flee instead since he does not want them to see what he is about to do. Naruto asks if his words imply that he is going to kill Sasuke, but Kakashi merely produces his Lightning Cutter and takes a stance towards Sasuke. Gritting his teeth, Naruto has a shadow clone restrain Kakashi while using the other to form his Rasengan, and rushes towards Sasuke, who is also running towards him.\nAs they head towards each other, Naruto recalls how he was treated when he was younger and muses how their roles could have been reversed, imagining himself using Chidori and Sasuke stopping him with Rasengan. The two remember their last battle at the Valley of the End as their attacks once more clash against one another; Sasuke and Naruto look at each other. In his mind, Naruto tells Sasuke that he could have been just like him, as he once hated all the villagers for treating him badly and that he wanted revenge against them too. He credits his change in attitude to Sasuke and Iruka, with whom he formed a bond, the latter even saving his life from Mizuki when Mizuki revealed to him that he was the vessel of the Nine-Tails. Naruto reflects on how he was happy to realise that Sasuke was an orphan like him and thought they could talk and bond over it; however, he and Sasuke had a chasm in skill between them and so Naruto decided to be his rival instead. Smiling, he declares that since that day, Sasuke has been his goal.",

  "description": "In his mind, Naruto reminisces on his memories with Sasuke, recalling when he and Sasuke fought together to trick Zabuza, how Sasuke mocked Naruto after he cowered from seeing the Demon Brothers, and how repeated those words back to Sasuke when they were attacked by Orochimaru in the Forest of Death. He reflects upon the good memories he had, such as when they tried to peek at Kakashi's face, as well as the not so good memory of their fight at the Valley of the End. Sasuke tells Naruto that he would not stop in his quest for vengeance and that Naruto would simply have to kill him or get killed, but Naruto states that he would not let either option happen.\nIn the real world, the Rasengan and Chidori clash against one another and explodes, causing Naruto and Sasuke to fall backwards towards the rock walls. Naruto's shadow clone flings Kakashi in Naruto's direction to catch him while one of White Zetsu's parasite clones catches Sasuke. Knowing that Sasuke would not retreat, White Zetsu visits Madara at his base, where the latter has Danzō's corpse as well as various Sharingan eyes stored. White Zetsu notifies Madara that Sasuke is in a bit of a bind, and Madara and Zetsu head to the Samurai Bridge.\nWhite Zetsu and his clones prepare to engage in combat against Naruto, but Madara tells him to stand down, alerting him that he would lose and thus he would set up a fight between Naruto and Sasuke in the future in order to obtain the Nine-Tails. Before they leave, Naruto tells Sasuke that if he ever does decide to attack Konoha, he would be waiting there for him, and would shoulder the burden of Sasuke's hatred. In anger, Sasuke lashes out and demands to know why Naruto is fixated on him, to which Naruto replies that it is because they are friends. Naruto asks whether Sasuke remembers what he had said during their fight at the Valley; how two high-level shinobi can reach others' minds when they exchange fists. Naruto tells Sasuke that he has finally understood what Sasuke is going through, and if it means exchanging blows, then he would continue to do so to further understand him. He asks Sasuke whether he read his mind too, but Sasuke shrugs him off and merely states that he does not wish to and that he would kill him. Smiling, Naruto tells him that if they fought, both of them would die; however, he is optimistic that at least in the afterlife they would be relieved of their respective burdens.\nKakashi tries to use Kamui to take out Madara, who quickly informs Kakashi that such a technique would not work on him. As they warp away, Sasuke informs Madara that he has something to ask of him. Naruto and his shadow clones quickly fall down, having been poisoned by the cut inflicted by Sasuke earlier; as Sakura administers the antidote, Kakashi locates Karin, who had witnessed the entire thing, and decides to bring her back with him to Konoha. At his base, Madara is asked by Sasuke to have Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan transplanted within his own, as he is beginning to lose his vision after having activated the Susanoo three times in less than a day. When Madara asks why Sasuke thinks he is ready for it now, Sasuke states that he needs the power of the Eternal Mangekyō if he has any chance of killing Naruto.",

The latter reveals that he's awake unlike the others and feels unease; sticking out his tongue, he and Sakura realise that his Cursed Tongue Eradication Seal is gone. Sai wonders whether it means that Danzō is dead, and Karin notifies them that Sasuke killed him. As they begin their walk back home, Naruto argues with Kiba, Sai, and Lee, and Karin perceives Naruto as the complete opposite of Sasuke, noting that his chakra makes her feel warm and comfortable. However, she senses the presence of another chakra, a more ominous one, that lies deep within him, terrifying her.\nBack in Konoha, Homura and Koharu receive word from Shikaku that the Root members are agitated. Three of them decide to seek out Sai, running into him as the others make their way back from the Land of Iron. Sai confirms that Danzō has been killed, and asks to discuss the future of Root with the new Hokage — Kakashi Hatake, much to the surprise of Lee, Sakura, and Kiba.\nThe Fourth Raikage, Killer B, C, and Darui return to Kumogakure. Karui and Omoi shed tears of joy to see their master Killer B alive and notice the blade he is carrying. Killer B tells them that the Samehada is a trophy of war he claimed from a battle, unaware that Kisame is stored within the blade. It is revealed that after Kisame had knocked B out, White Zetsu used a parasite clone to swap places with Kisame; while the real Kisame hid inside the Samehada blade, the clone was the one decapitated by A and B. The entire plan was conceived by Tobi in order to have Kisame infiltrate Kumo and gain intelligence on their responsive actions to the Fourth Shinobi World War.\nThe Raikage holds an audience with the Lightning Daimyō, gaining the approval for Kumo to officially join and lead the Allied Shinobi Forces. As he leaves the meeting, he notices Killer B holding a concert on a rooftop, and drop kicks him to the ground as a result.",

One of the councillors debates the idea of being allied with Konoha, since Danzō is the Hokage and Danzō is known for his duplicitous and shady tactics. However, a fellow shinobi interrupts the meeting to notify them that Team Kakashi had encountered Madara and Sasuke, and that the latter killed Danzō. Kankurō remarks how far Sasuke must have fallen in order to kill a Hokage and wonders whether Naruto would truly be able to save him from the darkness. Temari reminds him that it was Naruto who saved Gaara and when they could not and Gaara tells them that such is Naruto's power and what he does about concerning Sasuke is up to him.\nBack in the village, Shikamaru is notified by his father regarding the recent events. He heads to the front gates with Chōji and Ino to meet the incoming squad. Naruto tells them that he fought Sasuke but that he would share the details later, and asks Shikamaru if he would gather the other members of the Konoha 11 as he has news to share. Konohamaru, Udon and Moegi also come running up to Naruto, wanting to interview him for their newspaper, but Naruto tells them that he is busy and would do it some other time.

Meanwhile, Kakashi takes Karin to the Konohagakure Intelligence Division to be questioned. Naruto gathers the Konoha 11 and tells them his decision to fight Sasuke alone, much to their frustration. He refuses to explain why, simply asking them to trust him.\nHomura and Koharu, the village elders, agree with Suna's recommendation that Kakashi become their next Hokage. Kakashi wanders around Konoha thinking about his future as Hokage and looks at Minato's face on the monument. Just then, Might Guy appears and challenges him to race. Kakashi ultimately wins the race, albeit very closely, and Guy congratulates him on becoming Hokage, claiming that from now on Kakashi would be too busy for their challenges. However, Kakashi tells him that they will always be \"eternal rivals\" and that he is happy he is there and would need Guy's help running the village, leaving Guy in tears.\nLater, the members of the Land of Fire, including the Fire Daimyō, as well as the Konoha Council, hold a meeting to officially appoint Kakashi as the next Hokage. The daimyō is unsure about whether to appoint Kakashi as the sixth or the seventh Hokage, as he had appointed Danzō as the sixth earlier, although Danzō did not formally take office. Koharu protests that Danzō should still be recognised as the sixth, while Homura shakes his head. In the end, the daimyō makes his decision, only for Guy to burst into the room and inform them that Tsunade has awoken from her coma. The elders decide to have Tsunade resume her role as Hokage in order to present a stabilised front, relieving Kakashi. As the stone carver begins to carve Kakashi's face, he is once again stopped and informed that Tsunade will remain the Hokage, much to his frustration.",

Elsewhere, Obito asks Rin to wait a bit longer, as he wishes to aid Kakashi. Obito's chakra rises from his ashes and envelops Kakashi. Reunited, Obito reminds Kakashi to not follow him to the afterlife anytime soon, and tells him to become the Sixth Hokage, in which he gives him an \"early promotion gift\". Kaguya knocks Sasuke back, and Naruto attacks her with his enhanced Rasenshuriken, resulting in Kaguya undertaking an unstable Tailed Beast transformation.\nThe beast's hands begin attacking, and when they aim for Sakura, she is saved by Kakashi's Susanoo. As he joins the fight, Kaguya creates a gigantic Truth-Seeking Ball and reemerges. While Team 7 confronts her, Kakashi uses his new found techniques against Kaguya. Naruto and his disguised clone faces her, and when Kakashi warps away Black Zetsu's attack, Sasuke swaps with the clone as Sakura punches her. Kakashi remembers meeting his students, before Naruto and Sasuke make physical contact with Kaguya in order to seal her.",

  "description": "Kakashi watches proudly as Sakura prevents Kaguya from flying up, allowing Naruto and Sasuke to make physical contact with her, activating the fūinjutsu taught to them by Hagoromo. As her Rinne Sharingan is obscured, Kaguya wonders how scattered pieces of her chakra were able to seal her again. Hagoromo notices the seal was applied, and prepares to bring everyone back. Kaguya's Expansive Truth-Seeking Ball begins crumbling, the land begins sealing Kaguya, and Kaguya herself begins reverting into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, as the tailed beasts are separated from it.\nThe rabbit head left in it spits Madara's body out. Sasuke and the tailed beasts meet up with Kakashi and Sakura, while Naruto goes looking for Black Zetsu, who is already intent on scheming Kaguya's next resurrection. Naruto denounces Black Zetsu's role in shinobi history, calls it a spoiled brat who's too afraid to leave its mother's side, and throws it toward the forming moon, sealing it as well. Naruto meets up with the others, and Sakura wonders how they'll get out of Kaguya's dimension. Hagoromo summons everyone back with the aid of the previous Kage he called from the Pure Land. Hagoromo congratulates Kakashi on coordinating the sealing, though Kakashi downplays his role. Kakashi bids Obito farewell as Obito's chakra in him fades away. Hagoromo stops Sasuke from reaching Madara, who is about to die. Madara and Hashirama exchange their final words as Madara dies. Hagoromo announces he'll release the summoned Kage, including the ones from Impure World Reincarnation. Minato wishes Naruto happy birthday as dawn breaks. Naruto motormouths several things for Minato to tell Kushina as the Kage's spirits are released and go back to the afterlife.",

  "description": "At the Valley of the End, Naruto recalls Neji's words about Sasuke being in darkness. Sasuke explains that based on Itachi's life, he's come to the conclusion that a true Hokage is one who shoulders the hatred of others. Sasuke intends to concentrate all power and all hatred on himself. Naruto points out others would not agree with his plan, but Sasuke doesn't care. Sasuke is certain he has all the power he needs to carry out his plan. Naruto argues there are things that can't be done alone, like the fight against Kaguya. By killing the tailed beasts and the Kage, Sasuke wants to erase the darkness of the past. Naruto denounces erasing the past, having been shaped by his past as well. Hagoromo begins fading away, and tells Kakashi to keep having faith. Thinking of their answers, Hagoromo fades.\nNaruto and Sasuke begin fighting, first with taijutsu. Sasuke attacks with fireballs, which Naruto dodges. Naruto creates clones, which attack with Rasengan. Using the Rinnegan, Sasuke pulls Naruto and his clones toward himself, and skewers them with black flames. The real Naruto blocks it with chakra arms, and attacks Sasuke from above with more arms. Entering Six Paths Sage Mode, Naruto continues attacking with chakra arms. Sasuke sends another fireball his way, which Naruto blocks. Sasuke teleports behind Naruto, and sends him back with Chidori. Sasuke begins firing Susanoo arrows, which Naruto blocks with his Truth-Seeking Balls. Sasuke switches to a Complete Body Susanoo, and Naruto enters Tailed Beast Mode just in time to parry Sasuke's attack, fist-bumping him in the process. The two see each other's loneliness as children. Sasuke has Susanoo blow fireballs at Naruto, who dodges them, blocks Susanoo's swords with Kurama's tails, and tosses Susanoo down with them. Naruto hesitates using a Tailed Beast Ball when Susanoo is down, giving Sasuke an opportunity of using Kirin. Sasuke chastises Naruto for stalling. Naruto refuses to let Sasuke go alone again. The two clash with a Susanoo: Chidori and a Tailed Beast Ball. In each other's minds again, Sasuke expresses the need to kill Naruto. Naruto points out there's no guarantee the world Sasuke creates won't have the same darkness as before, and that the five villages are finally united at peace. Sasuke argues the only reason that happened is because were forced to band together to defeat common enemies in Akatsuki, Madara, and Kaguya. Naruto asks what happens after Sasuke dies, no longer fulfilling the role of common enemy. Sasuke answers that with the power of the Rinnegan, he has many ways of leading from the shadows. Still annoyed at Naruto's insistence in not killing him, Sasuke calls forth the Chibaku Tensei the tailed beasts are sealed in, in his first step into the shadows.",

  "description": "Sasuke channels the sealed tailed beasts' chakra into his Susanoo. Kurama marvels at how similar and different Sasuke is from Hagoromo, and warns Naruto not to let his guard down. Sasuke's enhanced Susanoo takes shape, and Naruto creates shadow clones, all of them in Tailed Beast Mode. Sasuke derides Naruto for using it, seeing it as a cover for Naruto's loneliness. Sasuke sends a couple of the clones crashing down, while cutting down limbs from others. Naruto manages to immobilise Susanoo for a moment, but his attacks do nothing against it. Naruto and Sasuke take the fight above the clouds. Sasuke uses lightning arrows against Naruto's Tailed Beast Balls, creating massive explosions.\nAs Sasuke prepares his next arrow, a previously downed Kurama shadow clone disperses, sending Naruto a massive amount of natural energy. Naruto merges the remaining Kurama shadow clones into a single, multi-armed, multi-faced avatar, creating a massive Rasenshuriken and Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken. Naruto reiterates his desire of beating Sasuke fair and square, though not the current Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke's attacks clash, causing a titanic explosion. The two crash down in a heavily damaged Valley of the End, exhausted. Seeing Naruto still alive, Sasuke uses Amaterasu. Naruto blocks it, coating himself in Kurama's chakra, and throws it aside. Naruto lands a few hits, and after Sasuke lands one himself, he paralyses Naruto's clones with electrified shuriken. Sasuke thinks he's hit the real Naruto with Chidori, but the real one hits him from the side. Sasuke doesn't have enough chakra to maintain Chidori, and Naruto stumbles with his Rasengan. Sasuke gets on top of Naruto and begins punching him. Naruto pulls him closer and headbutts him. The two continue landing hits on each other. Sakura wakes up, just remembering Sasuke and Naruto sparring in the Academy. It's dusk, and Sakura asks Kakashi where Naruto and Sasuke are. Kakashi tells her they're fighting. Naruto and Sasuke keep fighting, barely able to stand, or even land hits on one another. Kurama manages to mould some chakra, but Sasuke absorbs it with the Rinnegan. Sasuke uses it to attack with Chidori, but Naruto uppercuts him at the last moment, sending him back. Sasuke tells Naruto to let him kill him, but Naruto refuses. Kurama notices Sasuke's Kagutsuchi-infused Chidori. Kurama fist-bumps Naruto, giving him the last of its chakra, and thinks back to Naruto's resolve in saving Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke clash, the explosion of their attacks destroying what little is left from the Valley of the End.",

  "description": "Thinking back to their previous battles, Sasuke tells Naruto to disappear along with their bond as their attacks connect, resulting in an explosion. Both think back to sparring with one another in the Academy, both refusing to perform the Seal of Reconciliation at the end. They recall Naruto saying their next fight would result in their death, in the Land of Iron. As they shift through several significant locations from their past, the two wonder if they are dead.\nSasuke recalls how they were both ostracised from the village, wondering if in that sense, they really were brothers. Naruto denies that conclusion, apologises to Tsunade for dying before becoming Hokage, and worries about not being there to release the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sasuke scoffs at his concern with the living, and points out Sakura and Kakashi are still there, and will figure something out. He thinks of meeting Itachi again soon. Sasuke wakes up at nighttime, Naruto telling him if they move too much, they will bleed out and die. Sasuke asks why Naruto tried maintaining his bond with Sasuke once he started cutting them. Naruto points out again that he is his friend. Sasuke asks what that means to him. Naruto explains that seeing Sasuke take on so much hurts him. Sasuke thinks back to seeing Naruto seeking attention, how his attempts to bond reminded him of his own family, and how he also saw it as a weakness. Those sentiments only grew once they were assigned to the same team, and started going in missions together. Sasuke sees the memories of Naruto's struggles, and his exchanges with Itachi about what it means to be Hokage, and Sasuke realizes the importance of his friends. This time, Naruto and Sasuke wake up at dawn. Sasuke laughs when Naruto expresses his wish to keep fighting him in their state. As the sun rises, Sasuke admits defeat, and concludes that if he dies, the cycle of revenge will end with him. Sasuke tells Naruto he can release the Infinite Tsukuyomi after he dies by transplanting his Rinnegan into someone else. Naruto tells him if he is willing to die, he should live and help Naruto make all shinobi cooperate. Sasuke doubts others would want to cooperate with him, and is wary of turning against Naruto again. Naruto is certain he will not, and when Sasuke asks him how he knows, Naruto again alludes to their friendship. Sasuke begins to cry, and turns his face away. Naruto and Sasuke remain there, with their dominant arms destroyed and bleeding.",

  "description": "Sakura and Kakashi arrive at the edge of the destroyed Valley of the End, and spot Naruto and Sasuke on the ground. Sakura jumps down, and begins healing their arms. Naruto thanks her. Sasuke at first tells her not to bother with him, but when she tells them she needs to focus, a guilt-ridden Sasuke apologises for what he has done, driving her to tears. Kakashi watches his students smiling and laughing as he thinks back to first meeting them, and concludes Sasuke is finally back. Sasuke reflects on his and Naruto's paths. The roots of the God Tree wither, and the victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi are freed, Naruto and Sasuke performing the hand seals together with their remaining hands.\nSasuke frees the tailed beasts. Tenten hands Darui the Benihisago, allowing him to free Samui and Atsui. In Konoha, a funeral is held for those who died, including Shikaku, Inoichi, and Neji. Some time later, several hundred people flock to Konoha to see Naruto. Tsunade congratulates Kakashi on succeeding her as Hokage, dismissing his concern about the great amount of paperwork, pointing out if she managed it, so would he. The Raikage and Kazekage entourages arrive at Konoha, and meet up with Naruto. They ask him about his arm, and he explains Tsunade's plan of making him an arm from Hashirama's cells. Sasuke is held prisoner, bound in a full body jacket, and seals over his eyes. Guy is examined, and is told he can no longer be a shinobi as a consequence of his injuries, but that does not bother him. While taking Naruto to the Academy, Shikamaru confirms to him he is an aide to the Hokage now, and tells Naruto Kakashi is Hokage now. They meet up with Kakashi and Iruka. Kakashi tells Naruto he would like to appoint him as jōnin, but he needs to study. Iruka, Konohamaru, Moegi and Udon provide him with numerous study materials that will help him become a jōnin within two years. Naruto gets exasperated, until Konohamaru reminds him there are no shortcuts on becoming Hokage. Kakashi concedes that Naruto is a fine shinobi who picks up things fast, but he needs some knowledge as well, and that Shikamaru can help him with that. Iruka spends the day teaching him shinobi history. At night, on their way to ramen, Naruto thanks Iruka for acknowledging him years before, crediting that moment for who he has become. Touched, Iruka offers to treat Naruto with as much ramen as he wants. Kakashi visits Sasuke in prison. The next day, Sasuke is free, his plea and contributions for ending the war warranting him a pardon. Sasuke wants to see the world by himself to atone and grow as a person.

She then asks if she can accompany him but he again refuses, saying she has no part in his sins, leaving her disappointed.

On his way, he passes by Sasuke, who overhears adults talking about Naruto's involvement in the Fourth Hokage's death. Naruto sulks by himself at home, and leaves to train in the forest.\nStill hungry, Naruto collects several mushrooms, and catches fish in a nearby stream. As he eats them by a fire, he is joined by Hiruzen, unaware he's the Third Hokage. Naruto offers him fish. The two talk over the fire about the world. The next day, Naruto thinks about what Hiruzen told him about the world being much bigger than any one person.\n\nNeji trains in taijutsu with his father. Hizashi calls it a day, despite Neji's insistence in continuing training. Neji asks him about his cousin, and Hizashi tells him it's a girl one year younger than Neji. Hizashi begins telling Neji about his role as a Hyūga. Neji spars with Hinata. Hinata confides in Neji she dislikes training in taijutsu, and he tells her she has an important role as the heiress of the Hyūga. At Hizashi's funeral, Hinata feels for Neji. Hinata wanders off, and ends up meeting Naruto, who walks her home. After Naruto leaves, Hiashi arrives and begins teaching Hinata about the clan.",

Sasuke takes Itachi's constant claims of business as proof he dislikes him. Itachi denies it, pokes him in the forehead, and tells Sasuke the next time their parents are off, he might have time to spend with Sasuke. At dinner, Sasuke asks them about it, and they confirm they'll be off visiting Mikoto's family.\nThey offer to take Sasuke, and are surprised to learn Itachi said he'd teach Sasuke.

Ino gives her a ribbon to tie her hair with. Sakura is concerned about exposing her forehead, but Ino tells her people tease only because she tries hiding it. Sakura tells her parents she's made a friend. Sakura takes Ino to her hideout, where Ino rearranges her flowers.

  "description": "A baby Gaara dreams of his mother, and cries at her absence. As children, Gaara and his siblings play on a sandbox, Gaara using his control over sand to create complex and detailed structures. At Kankurō's request, Gaara makes sculptures of food, exasperating Temari. Their father calls Kankurō and Temari away. Villagers watching from afar are afraid of Gaara, and throw a stone at him, which is blocked by the sand. Under Rasa's watch, Gaara is attacked with kunai, to no effect.\nAt night, Gaara asks his uncle why they feel hungry. Yashamaru tells him that maybe it's so they can have good food. While playing in the sandbox, Gaara asks him why the sky is blue, and Yashamaru tells him it's so they can look up at it. Gaara agrees that looking at the sky eases his pain. Gaara asks why he doesn't get sleepy, and why he doesn't have a mother. Yashamaru evades answering. Kankurō and Temari want to play with Gaara, but their father keeps them from doing so. Yashamaru arrives with lunch, and Gaara notices how he resembles his mother.\n\nAt the Academy, Shikamaru pays no attention to class, and throws a pencil at a sleeping Chōji, startling him. Iruka chastises him for sleeping. Knowing it was Shikamaru who woke him up, Chōji throws books at him. Naruto complains about the noise, as he is trying to sleep. Iruka sends the three of them to the hallway. Chōji offers them snacks, and when Iruka comes see them, they're standing asleep. Iruka scares them awake. Later, Chōji asks Shikamaru for money to buy more snacks. In a later class, Naruto stands up to bullies bothering Hinata. Shikamaru thinks Naruto is stupid for intruding in other people's problems instead of minding his own. Chōji criticises Shikamaru for thinking so. The two begin fighting, but Naruto interrupts it, and the three end up laughing. After class, the three see Sasuke rejecting a flower from Ino. She notices them, and runs after them. After losing her, they see Iruka flirting with some women. Naruto approaches him, and uses the Sexy Technique. At night, Chōji and Shikamaru bid him farewell.",

  "description": "A man called Tadaichi leaves a hot spring. As a storm brews, he is approached by someone on the road, wanting to confirm his status as a Konoha shinobi. Tadaichi confirms he's from Konoha, but denies being a shinobi, claiming to be just a merchant. The person reveals they checked his Anbu history, and uses a dōjutsu against him. The person is approached by another, congratulating them. The first promises to stain everything red. Sakura and Naruto visit Kakashi. Sakura asks about missing Konoha shinobi, which Kakashi is already aware of. An explosion happens by one of Konoha's gates. Naruto and Sakura go investigate. Five people are attacking the security personnel from the gates.\nIno, Shikamaru and Chōji arrive at the scene, where Ino recognises Tadaichi as a regular from Yamanaka Flowers, certain he'd never turn against the village. Tadaichi is hit with a shuriken, but feels no pain, and begins expanding. Naruto creates clones and takes the security personnel away from Tadaichi, who explodes. The explosion slightly injures the other four attackers, who move into the village and begin expanding as well. At Shikamaru's suggestion, Chōji expands himself, and uses his butterfly wings to flap at the explosion. Naruto adds to it with a Rasengan. More controlled attackers appear beyond the gate, and Sakura deduces the injuries are what is causing them to explode. Hinata arrives, and upon learning of the situation, she confirms there is no one near casting genjutsu, though she detects a foreign chakra in the attackers. Shikamaru restrains the attackers with his shadow, and Hinata attacks their chakra network, defeating them without triggering explosions. Later, Sakura tries releasing the genjutsu, but is unsuccessful. Kakashi decides to have Sasuke analyse the genjutsu with his dōjutsu, and asks Sai to inform him. Elsewhere, Sasuke thinks back to his journey, and feeds a few stray cats. Noticing one of Sai's ink hawks, Sasuke opens up a scroll, and the hawk turns into a message in it. Sasuke hears an explosion nearby, where controlled people are also exploding upon being injured, which Sasuke recognises as the same ones from Konoha's message. Two shinobi come to the aid of an older man in the attacked village, Iō. Iō mistakes Sasuke for an attacker, and commands the other two to attack him. Sasuke easily counters Chino's Water Release with his Fire Release, and dodges Nowaki's wind-infused weapons. The attackers cross Chino's water wall, and Sasuke stops them with his Sharingan, surprising Chino. Sasuke asks them about the one Iō mistook him with, but Iō refuses to talk. Chino explains she and Nowaki are former shinobi who are now wandering performers. Iō wants to check on his daughter Amino. Inside the shelter, Amino is also under the genjutsu, causing others to run away. She stabs herself in the neck, and explodes. Iō screams he will never forgive Fūshin, and runs into the fire. Sasuke questions one of the people he released from the genjutsu about who Fūshin is. He is told Fūshin is the leader of the Lightning Group, a group who steals money from bad people and gives it to those in need. After the group was supposedly betrayed by Kirigakure, they asked for shelter in the village, who refused to harbour them in fear of retaliation. Sasuke tries using genjutsu to see into the memories of the controlled attackers, but meets resistance in the memories, seeing a red eye. Sasuke surmises it's a kekkei genkai.",

Chino and Nowaki confirm Sasuke's identity, and want to join the investigation. Chino continues to pester Sasuke with questions, but Nowaki tells her to stop. Sasuke confirms he's looking for Fūshin, and is certain the exploding humans were created through a kekkei genkai. Sasuke leads them to a cave entrance, where they meet Yamato, who is keeping an eye on Orochimaru. Sasuke wants to speak with Orochimaru, believing him to have information about the exploding humans.\nYamato allows them passage into the cave. Sasuke asks Orochimaru for information, who reveals Fūshin does possess a kekkei genkai, and was a member of En Oyashiro's guard, an arm dealer. Orochimaru tells him his hideout is even more concealed than his own, but he knows how to draw him out. The rest of Taka arrives, Karin immediately picking a fight with Chino over Sasuke. Orochimaru returns, and says he'll join Sasuke on a journey to an island for the wealthy, where En Oyashiro should go if he takes Orochimaru's bait. They take a boat. Taka discusses Sasuke's situation. Orochimaru is followed by Yamato. Orochimaru and Sasuke discuss how neither of them should be able to move so freely, and the only reason they were free was because they might be useful in the future, should another evil come along though he reiterates that his friend Naruto wouldn't think in this manner. The group arrives at the island, where the Coliseum is. Orochimaru explains it's a fighting club for the rich, where they have the shinobi under their employ fight. Sasuke say he's not interested, and Orochimaru explains En will appear if there are shinobi he's interested in. Chino asks Sasuke why he doesn't help, explaining that to the victim, their assailant and third parties who do nothing are equally guilty. The announcer introduces Futsu, a shinobi employed by En, and to Sasuke's surprise, announces him as the opponent, employed by Orochimaru. Orochimaru explains En collects kekkei genkai, and is always in disguise, so by having the chance to collect Sasuke, he should come forward. Sasuke goes in to fight, Futsu being a Boil Release user. Just as the fight begins, one of the patrons falls by the stage, Sasuke recognising the signs of him being an exploding human.",

More members of the audience start to display signs of being exploding humans. Yamato arrives, assuring Sasuke they can't all be saved, so they should try lessening the damage, as he encases a nearby exploding human in wood. Orochimaru himself smothers an explosion with his snakes. Sasuke dodges a chakra-enhanced knife thrown at him, that explodes when it hits the floor. Sasuke begins following his assailant, but chooses to rescue Chino from an explosion instead.\nChino expresses surprise at Sasuke's decision. They're joined by Nowaki, and Yamato, who confirms to Sasuke those are the same exploding humans that attacked Konoha. Yamato leaves, and Orochimaru tells them En Oyashiro won't stick around after such a commotion. A Coliseum employee informs Orochimaru that En is interested in meeting Sasuke. The two meet En, and are unimpressed by him. Orochimaru questions why someone so secretive would reveal himself to them.\n\nEn tells them he's heard from the attack on Konoha, and speculates that was done to target Sasuke, as he was also attacked in the Coliseum. Sasuke asks about Fūshin, En tells him he won Fūshin at the Coliseum, having heard Fūshin was born in the Land of Water, and being sold off because others feared his kekkei genkai, though he himself admires kekkei genkai for their rarity and power. He says one day, Fūshin ran away with other kekkei genkai users of his guard. Sasuke asks if Fūshin had red eyes, En answers one of the guards who left with Fūshin did, who hailed from the Chinoike clan, and wielded the Ketsuryūgan. Originally from the Land of Lightning, before Hashirama and Madara competed for power, a woman from the Chinoike clan was sent to be a concubine for the daimyō, which caused jealousy in his wife. He died shortly after, and the wife accused the concubine of being responsible. With the clan's reputation, they were exiled to the Valley of Hell, the wife hiring the Uchiha clan to do it, as their Sharingan allowed them to go up against the Ketsuryūgan. The Chinoike asked to negotiate with the Uchiha, but they refused.\nSasuke wonders if Itachi knew about this, but Orochimaru has no idea. Sasuke asks En where the Valley of Hell is, being told is in the Land of Hot Water. Orochimaru finds En's forthcoming strange, and he explains that if such an explosive became commonplace, he'd be driven out of business. Sasuke, Chino and Nowaki go to the Land of Hot Water. The three come across a large group of exploding humans, that Sasuke quickly puts to sleep. Sasuke blocks another chakra-enhanced knife with Susanoo. Sasuke pursues an assailant who keeps throwing knives, but those aren't chakra-enhanced. Sasuke uses one of them to break end the pursuit, though it's not Fūshin. He attacks Sasuke with earth walls and rubber balls. Sasuke makes short work of him with Amaterasu, and puts it out to check his memories with the Sharingan. He learns Nowaki is Fūshin, who shows himself before Sasuke. Sasuke figured as much from the chakra blade he deflected being the same used against him in the Bamboo Village. Sasuke asks Fūshin to show his real appearance, and Fūshin complies.",

Sasuke dodges Fūshin's exploding chakra blades, getting nearer to Fūshin, but he increases the strength of the windstorm, turning it into a typhoon. It takes Sasuke manifesting his Complete Body-Susanoo to cut through Fūshin's typhoon. Fūshin creates a greater typhoon, and Sasuke dispels his Susanoo, and takes advantage of the eye of the storm, where there is no wind, to get to Fūshin and strike him with Chidori. Sasuke tries reading his memories with the Sharingan, but again meets resistance from the Ketsuryūgan.\nIt takes Sasuke using his Mangekyō Sharingan to break free. Fūshin is no longer there. Sasuke makes his way to the Valley of Hell, and wonders if the Chinoike clan really lived there. Chino reveals herself, telling him they did. Chino tells Sasuke about the plights of being forced to live there, and how she was alone by the time En kidnapped her. The mention of her loneliness reminds Sasuke of himself and Naruto. Sasuke's interest in her loneliness causes her to show him her story with the Ketsuryūgan, being forced to become a shinobi by En Oyashiro. After she awakened the Ketsuryūgan, En made her fight in the Coliseum, where she defeated Fūshin, causing him to belong to En Oyashiro. Chino befriends him as they talk about kekkei genkai and how each sees the other's past. One day, they found historical documents about the Chinoike clan, Fūshin suggesting them go to the Valley of Hell look for them. They gathered people who wanted to escape Oyashiro and fled. They came in defence of the Bamboo Village one day, and came to be known as the Lightning Group after fighting for the sake of poor villages. Kirigakure began to employ them, until they decided to get rid of them. The group sought asylum at the villages they had helped, where they were denied, out of fear Kirigakure would retaliate against them. Two of their group died and Karyū left, leaving only the two of them, so they finally reach the Valley of Hell. Chino despairs as nothing there triggers any memory of her past. They are attacked by Kirigakure shinobi, and in the fight, Chino causes one of them to explode with her Ketsuryūgan. Chino vows revenge for her clan.",

  "description": "Chino confirms to Sasuke she intended to use the exploding humans to attack him and Konoha in vengeance against the Uchiha for driving her clan to the Valley of Hell, but ended up meeting him in the Bamboo Village. Her plans changed after Iō last words put Sasuke on Fūshin's track. Chino explains the Chinoike clan's jutsu uses blood, and that with the high iron content of the lake in the Valley of Hell, she'll be even more powerful. She uses her blood and the lake to create a multi-headed blood dragon, but Sasuke quickly decapitates all of its heads with his electrified sword.\n\nChino manages to wound Sasuke, and as his wound closes, she uses the Ketsuryūgan to show him himself turning into an exploding human. Sasuke asks her if that's how she creates them, and Chino realises she's under the Sharingan's genjutsu, Sasuke standing on her blood dragon, which collapses. Chino envied Sasuke because he always had someone to love him, while she was alone from the start, which reminds Sasuke of Naruto and Sakura. Chino asks Sasuke why he still fights for Konoha, and he tells her about Naruto. Chino isn't convinced the world they want to bring about can be a reality, and tells Sasuke to kill her. Fūshin arrives, in bad shape, and tells Sasuke he'll have to kill him to get to Chino. Sasuke tells Chino his words to her should make sense now. Chino asks Fūshin not to fight, as she couldn't bear losing him. Chino wishes she hadn't met him in the Bamboo Village, so she could still hate him, and wishes to see the world Sasuke spoke of.\nIn Konoha, guided by Hinata's Byakugan, Sakura finishes extracting the foreign chakra infecting the exploding humans. They talk about the apprehension of the perpetrators, and how Sasuke wasn't there when they thought he would be. In prison, Kakashi meets Chino, Fūshin and Karyū, and Chino claims responsibility for the incident. Kakashi tells them the Mizukage wants to take custody of them. Mei arrives with Chōjūrō, and aware of their past connection with the village, wants them to help Kirigakure, as a form of atonement.\nAt the Coliseum, Sasuke challenges all the shinobi, to earn them all their freedom. Chino is concerned about him fighting so many shinobi with kekkei genkai, but Naruto assures her Sasuke will win. After defeating all the shinobi, Futsu asks Sasuke what will happen to them. He says Kumogakure will take them in. The Raikage arrives with C, Darui, and several other shinobi. As the island of the Coliseum is nearest to Kumogakure, Kakashi argued with the Raikage they're his responsibility, as well as arresting all the Coliseum's patrons. A tells Sasuke about the time Naruto begged him not to kill him, and how he's glad he didn't.\nEn Oyashiro meets up with Orochimaru, having escaped arrest. They discuss the Chinoike clan, En Oyashiro revealing himself to have the Ketsuryūgan, to be Chino's father, and to have killed the clan. Seeing how Chino's time in the Coliseum was harming her, he coordinated with Orochimaru to use Sasuke to stop her.\nNaruto and Sakura discuss Sasuke. Sasuke receives a message from Naruto by hawk, where Naruto says Sasuke protecting the village is like he's from the Konoha Police Force, which sparks in Sasuke a memory from talking with Itachi about wanting to join. Sasuke thinks maybe it's time to visit Konoha.",

  "description": "Shikamaru and Yurito handle documents for Kakashi. Kakashi tells them they should take a break sometimes. During a break, Shikamaru looks at the clouds, and Yurito asks if he gets bored with a desk job. Yurito tells him he sounds like an old man sometimes. At the end of the day, Shikamaru and Kakashi discuss how things have changed during peace times, and how Shikamaru is doing a desk job so he can help Naruto become Hokage in the future. Kakashi invites Shikamaru to eat, but Shikamaru has a game scheduled with Ōnoki. At the game, Shikamaru beats him. Later that night, Shikamaru trains.\nDuring the day, Shikamaru performs his duties as Kakashi's aide. Shikamaru arrives late for barbecue with Ino and Chōji, where they discuss what they've been up to. Shikamaru says he has to leave for Shinobi Union business. On a Shinobi Union meeting, Shikamaru is asked about the drop in mission requests, but says it's still being investigated. Later, Temari tries getting more information out of him, but when he evades her questions, she slaps him. Shikamaru informs Kakashi Temari is growing suspicious of him, and that their independent investigation on the Land of Silence could lead to Shinobi Union intervention due to rogue and missing shinobi potentially undertaking illegal missions there. They finally receive word from Sai, who left to infiltrate the Land of Silence. Sai's report gets them worried, and Shikamaru requests two Anbu to accompany him to the Land of Silence. Shikamaru is introduced to Rō and Hinoko, who were selected based on Shikamaru's mention of preferred abilities. Shikamaru visits his father's and Asuma's graves. At Asuma's grave, he is met by Kurenai, Mirai, and her babysitter. Early in the morning, Shikamaru runs into Naruto, who's on his way home from breakfast at Ichiraku. Shikamaru meets up with Rō and Hinoko by Konoha's gate, ready to leave for the Land of Silence.",

  "description": "Someone tries pitting Sai against Konoha, questioning his position in Team 7 and pointing out Sasuke's return. Shikamaru, Hinoko, and Rō scout Sai's last known location, an inn. Shikamaru has disguised them as merchants to get past a checkpoint into a village, Tobari, while Hinoko argues it would be easier to kill the lookouts. Shikamaru points out doing so could reveal Konoha's involvement, and that Sai's team was killed. While Shikamaru talks of teamwork, Hinoko uses her chakra needles to kill a shinobi spying on them. She kills another one, who ends up falling on top of the vehicle they were using to pass as merchants. Shikamaru goes to the inn, where he manages to get information playing shōgi with a patron.\nHe takes off before Hinoko can expose them, and chastises her for being so rash, while she refuses to botch a mission by being overly cautious. Rō tells Shikamaru she fears shinobi will be made obsolete in peace times, having not had the chance to prove her worth during the last war. The inn is interdicted, the shinobi Hinoko incapacitated outside being discovered, so everyone inn can only leave after having their identification verified. They escape with the help of Komori, who dislikes Tobari officials. Hinoko argues with Shikamaru about being allowed to act in the mission, and wonders she'd have more freedom in the Land of Silence. She storms off and talks with Komori in the inn, venting about her frustrations. As she returns, she overhears Rō and Shikamaru talking about silencing her if she truly wishes to desert Konoha. Komori tells her how to reach the Tobari checkpoint. Shikamaru and Rō follow her, but are interrupted by enemy shinobi. Hinoko reaches the checkpoint, where she announces her wish to join the Land of Silence, and incapacitates one of the guards to prove her skill. The guards notice the wound inflicted by her jutsu is the same on their killed comrades, and talk about a Konoha Anbu that spied on them a while back. Before they attack her, Komori shows up, vouching for her. Shikamaru and Rō arrive, and a fight ensues. Rō stops Shikamaru from harming Hinoko, saying they're misunderstanding her. Hinoko kills them both with her chakra needles, proving herself, and is brought inside. She puts Komori to sleep, and rejoins Shikamaru and Rō, who she only put in a death-like state for a while. Rō and Shikamaru suspected Komori when Rō faked a chakra presence in the inn and he reacted to it. The three successfully infiltrate Tobari.",

  "description": "Shikamaru wakes up from nightmares of the death of Asuma and the times his comrades were injured. Rō asks him about the nightmares. Shikamaru notices the lack of wind in Tobari. Hinoko feigns being killed by her own jutsu during initiation, and is taken to a room full of corpses. Shikamaru shows Rō the little intel they have on Gengo, a single blurry photo. Hinoko reunites with Rō and Shikamaru, informing them about how no one seems to know anything about Gengo or the Fushū Castle. The three go around Tobari gathering information, seeing people from all over, learning Gengo arrived ten years prior, and that Tobari is better now than it was then.\nThey spot a former Konoha Anbu, Minoichi, who went missing in the last war, after killing his unit. The three corner Minoichi and interrogate him, learning more of Gengo's ideology. Minoichi recognises Rō and puts him in a choke hold, hinting at his past, but Hinoko incapacitates him with her chakra needle. Rō wakes up after having nightmares about his past as a genin, when he survived the slaughter of his unit by burying himself in the corpses of his comrades and suppressing his chakra to appear dead. That night, Gengo appears for a public speech. Shikamaru wants to move closer to the stage so his jutsu can reach him, and Hinoko goes to a tower where she has a clear view of the entire crowd. During his speech, Gengo reveals a restrained Sai, and the crowd asks for his death. Gengo's words begin to affect the three of them. Shikamaru and Rō create a diversion with explosive tags, and Shikamaru tries saving Sai, but he retaliates, having been entranced by Gengo. Gengo's words affected Rō and Hinoko, who are restrained. Gengo tries converting Shikamaru after Sai binds him, but Shikamaru begins strangling himself with his shadow.",

He is shackled in a cell, and thinks shōgi movements to pass the time. Sai arrives with food, and compliments him for resisting Gengo for so long. Shikamaru asks for his lighter, and Sai says it'll be returned once Shikamaru follows Gengo. The two discuss Sai's current condition, and why Shikamaru came instead of someone from Team 7. A while later, Rō is tossed in a cell near Shikamaru, who asks if he is ok, and if Hinoko is with him.\nGengo uses his jutsu on Hinoko. Shikamaru is taken to talk with Gengo, who has looked him up. Gengo tells Shikamaru how he perceives the current shinobi world, and how peace, as it exists, is forced by the great nations. Gengo shows him a flower that grows in the Land of Silence, that dies if taken out of its environment, and compares it to shinobi, who stop developing their skills in times of peace. Shikamaru notices that the flowers' scent stirs up unpleasant memories, which Gengo uses to turn shinobi to his side. Shikamaru asks for Rō and Hinoko, which are revealed to be the guards that brought him to the flowers, having been converted by Gengo. Shikamaru escapes the room. Shikamaru returns to Gengo's room, and fights Rō and Hinoko. He has Hinoko attack him with her chakra needles, and positions himself so they hit his ears, impairing his hearing so Gengo's voice can't affect him. Shikamaru almost reaches Gengo, but is stopped by Sai's ink lion. Gengo escapes, and Shikamaru is hit with a chakra needle on his head. Ino and Chōji arrive to save him, though Shikamaru believes he is dreaming. Shikamaru is convinced that he isn't dreaming when Temari slaps him for lying to her in the Shinobi Union meeting. Ino and Chōji prepare to fight Rō and Hinoko. Temari tosses him Asuma's chakra blades, which Shikamaru uses to open up the way to Gengo.",

Gengo lures Shikamaru in a dark room, both so he can't use his shadows and for his hearing to become more sensitive, and more vulnerable to Gengo's jutsu. Gengo tells Shikamaru about his past with Zabuza, and how it shaped his ideology. Ino enters Sai's mind to break Gengo's hold on him.\nHe asks about Shikamaru, and tells them that they have to warn Shikamaru not to turn around when Gengo is trying to convert him. Gengo tells Shikamaru he had his followers infiltrate the hidden villages, and with a signal he can make them cause incidents all over. Gengo's jutsu manifests the darkness in Shikamaru, but thinking of Naruto, Shikamaru isn't affected by it, to Gengo's surprise. Shikamaru surmises Gengo's comrades are all dead, having been used by him. Temari and the others reach their location, and Shikamaru calls on Rō and Hinoko to finish their mission.

Sai isn't sure he can express himself in such a manner, but Sakura forces him to record a message as well. Sai struggles, coming off too stiff or too forced. Lee delivers a high-spirited message getting too close to the camera, Tenten finding it doesn't quite come across as congratulatory. Guy thinks there should be something symbolic onscreen, and suggests recording the message during the sunrise. Ino begins recording her message, but gets angry with Chōji and Shikamaru's comments. Akamaru suddenly topples her, and Kiba takes over the recording, sparking an argument with Ino.\nKonohamaru is bothered he can't seem to find someone to record a proper message. Konohamaru tries Iruka, who is very nervous, asks to postpone it so he can think of something to say. The next day, while trying to come up with something, Iruka finds Sadoru, a new Academy instructor, distressed by vandalism from students. He easily spots the perpetrators and when they try claiming they were just playing hide and seek, he tricks one of them into admitting to the vandalism, impressing Sadoru. Iruka comments that compared to Naruto, that was nothing. Sadoru is impressed, but the vandals think he's making it up, so Iruka adds to their punishment. Iruka reflects on how the village sees Naruto. Iruka is invited to take an exam for being vice-principal position in the Academy. Kakashi looks over the schedule for missions, seeing that if all of Naruto's friends go to the reception, there will be unfulfilled missions on the day. Konohamaru tries recording a message from Orochimaru, but Yamato covertly and emphatically tells him not to do it. Shizune tells Kakashi that Tsunade made a rule to determine which shinobi get to attend shinobi weddings based on their gifts, much to his dislike. Konohamaru and Ebisu find Iruka at Ichiraku, and Ebisu gets self-conscious upon learning of Iruka's offer. Kakashi asks what's up, having been there for a while without being noticed. When they tell him about Iruka's possible promotion, he says it would be difficult. After he leaves, the others discuss what he meant. Iruka decides to take the exam for vice-principal, and his efforts are visible to all in Konoha. Tsukune, one of the vandals, steals the Scroll of Seals after learning Naruto did that. Kakashi almost explains what he meant in Ichiraku about Iruka, but Shizune tells him about the scroll's theft. Iruka finds Sansho and Mibuna, some of the vandals, who confirm his suspicion. He finds the vandal and the scroll at the Hokage Rock, and apologises for always comparing his students to previous students, realising he just wanted attention. The vandal promises to try harder. Kakashi shows Iruka the scroll just has an Icha Icha volume, as if he'd leave the scroll where someone could steal it so easily. He then explains that what he meant about the exam being difficult is that it's on the same day as Naruto's wedding, and considers moving the exam to another day, but Iruka decides not to take it, noting his failure to notice his current students. Kakashi decides to make getting a wedding gift for Naruto and Hinata a mission, so he can determine who should go to the wedding and who should be on mission duty on that day.",

Ino says she already picked her present, and says they can't go shop with her when Shikamaru wants to go to the same store. At Yakiniku Q, Shikamaru discusses with Chōji about ideas, and is shocked to find he's already picked a gift, vouchers for dinner at a fancy tea house. Shikamaru considers giving them cash, so they pick whatever they want, but considers it to be too impersonal and lazy for a gift.\nSomething Chōji says about eating ice-cream in a snowy place inspires Shikamaru to give them a honeymoon. The two come across Temari, and she and Shikamaru exchange awkward words. Chōji suggests getting Temari to give him a woman's point of view for a honeymoon location. Shikamaru asks her about it, but the two misunderstand each other, Temari thinking Shikamaru wants to go on a honeymoon with her. The two spend the day together. Ino goes to the store, and is about to get a portrait frame for Naruto and Hinata, but Sakura shows up, also intending to get the same gift. Ino and Sakura try psyching each other out of buying the frame, and end up being kicked out of the store for upsetting other customers. The two begin arguing who is more feminine and ask a passing Chōji for his opinion. Chōji says he thinks women who can cook are very feminine, and the two decide to make food pills. Both use ninjutsu skills to make pills. Chōji tries them both and is overwhelmed by how good they are, but since the eat them both together, he doesn't know which is which. Chōji passes out, while trying to figure out what happened, Ino and Sakura try each other's food pills, really enjoying them. Chōji wakes up, figuring all the ice-cream he ate earlier made his blood sugar go too high. Sakura and Ino decide to go find gifts together. Shikamaru and Temari almost go in a hot spring inn together, and they finally understand what the other meant, only Temari beats him up. Chōji, Ino, and Shikamaru discuss their progress at Ramen Ichiraku.",

  "description": "Gaara, Temari, and Kankurō arrive at Konoha, where they're greeted by Kakashi and Shizune. Kakashi confirms the arrival of other Kage, with the Mizukage still to arrive due to bad weather. Ōnoki asks Kakashi about Naruto's wedding, intending to give him a gift on Iwa's behalf. A also intends to send a gift on Kumo's behalf. Gaara learns of Naruto's wedding. Later, Kankurō asks Temari why they didn't know of that, considering she just visited Konoha. Temari angrily says she forgot, scaring Kankurō. Kankurō suggests something extravagant. Lee and Tenten arrive, on duty to show them around the village. Gaara asks to see places Naruto likes.\nTemari wants to stay in, and avoiding running into Shikamaru. At Ramen Ichiraku, Ayame notices Iruka has been coming there a lot lately. Teuchi notices that shinobi through the village are all trying to figure out what to give Naruto, and despite not being a shinobi, he also has come up with a gift, a free ramen pass. However, they don't know for how long the pass be worth, worried about Naruto going through all their ramen. Gaara asks Lee if he's gotten Naruto a gift already, which Lee confirms. Gaara ponders this is the first time he's had to give a wedding gift. Tenten is apprehensive when Lee begins getting overactive over telling Gaara about his gift and how he decided on it. Lee and Tenten take Gaara and Kankurō to Ramen Ichiraku, where they meet Iruka. They further discuss what to give Naruto, and have ramen. Killer B runs into the four, and is also giving Naruto a gift. Killer B mentions a dance number, and Kankurō feels Gaara should also perform. When A learns of B saying he'll dance, he almost makes a scene, but when the Mizukage misunderstands B about wedding, she intimidates him. The Five Kage meet, and Kakashi asks them to exercise moderation in their gifts. Temari runs into Shikamaru, the two apologise for their misunderstanding last time, and go out to eat together. Ino and Chōji spy on their date. Gaara goes to dine at Ramen Ichiraku, and Iruka apologises for putting pressure on him to give an extravagant gift. When Iruka says he's happy Naruto has made so many friends, Gaara is inspired to give him a gift not as Kazekage, but as his friend. As Ayame locks up, Teuchi decides to make Naruto's free pass lifelong. Kakashi, Lee and Tenten say good-bye to Gaara, Kankurō and Temari. Gaara intends to come back for Naruto's wedding, Kankurō is sad he won't see Gaara dance, and they notice Temari is in a much better mood. They realise they can still see Gaara dance as Naruto's friend.",

  "description": "Shino has his kikaichū report to him about others buying Naruto and Hinata's wedding gifts. He shows the insects to Academy students, one of them wanting to become Hokage, much like Naruto. Iruka watches them from afar. Shino encourages them to follow their dreams. Shino meets up with Kiba, who complains he's late. Shino tells him all their friends have already gotten a gift. Kiba is taking buying the wedding gift as a very serious mission, as it's the last mission they'll have as Team 8. The two ask Kurenai for advice. Kurenai tells them about a rare honey wine that the Senju clan would gift in certain occasions.\nThe two leave for Sora-ku, where a beekeeper who supposedly makes the wine lives. They come across a ninneko, Momo, who refuses to share information with them, antagonising them over Akamaru and their dog and insect scents. They try baiting him with catnip and pursue it, but Tamaki protects him, and apologises for his behaviour. Kiba flirts with Tamaki. Tamaki gives them directions to find the beekeeper. When looking for him, Shino ends up being lost in thought and loses track of Kiba. Shino is attacked by the beekeeper, but manages to deceive him. The beekeeper assumes Shino wants to kill him, but just gives him the honey wine when asked for it. Shino asks for directions to leave, but is told there is something like a barrier, keeping those who come in wandering around. The fog has a component that stirs doubt on those in it. Kiba manages to leave the area with no problem, while Shino recalls his earlier conversations with Academy students, Kiba, and Kurenai, which lead him to question how to live as a shinobi after Team 8. The beekeeper tries to keep Shino enslaved to his doubt, but his resolve to find a new path allows him to leave. Shino meets up with Kiba, and the two leave with the honey wine. Shino speaks with the Academy students again, further motivating them. Iruka suggests Shino should be a teacher.",

  "description": "Kakashi and Shizune review the wedding gifts for Naruto and Hinata. Kakashi leans towards having Lee, Guy, and Konohamaru on duty. Kakashi goes out on a stroll, and meets up with Hinata, who is going to meet the other girls. Konohamaru finds Iruka at Ramen Ichiraku, and demands he finally record a message for Naruto and Hinata. Iruka is still unsure what to say, recalling that Gaara decided to celebrate Naruto as his friend instead of Kazekage, and wondering what role he should be, though understanding most would consider him Naruto's teacher.\nWhile meeting with Hinata, Sakura almost slips about the mission for getting them wedding gifts. Later, with Team 8, Kiba almost slips about the mission. Tsunade comes by the Hokage's office and Shizune tells her about the mission and Kakashi's predicament of judging the gifts, while Konohamaru overhears them, deciding to hand in his video without a message from Iruka. Konohamaru informs the others of the judging of their gifts, which Hinata overhears, distressing her. Hinata goes see Kakashi about the mission. The others go to Kakashi and offer to rotate between missions and the wedding reception, allowing everyone to participate, and Kakashi being Hokage can change the rule. Tsunade points out this situation is different, as the rule was made at a time when there was a boom in shinobi weddings during a war, and that Kakashi should rule as he sees fit. Iruka comes across a distressed Hinata, and wrongly assumes Naruto is to blame, and starts to apologise for him. Hinata finds it hilarious. Iruka talks with Kakashi, and gives him an idea, while also telling Konohamaru that Hinata found out about the mission, so his video is no longer a surprise. Kakashi asks the other Kage if they can spare shinobi for the missions of the day of the wedding, and Konohamaru tries recording a message from them.",

Iruka still doesn't know what to say. He scolds Tsukune, Mibuna, and Sansho for vandalising the Third Hokage's statue again. Sadoru asks Iruka if he'll be making a speech during the ceremony, but Iruka says Kakashi will do it.\nAyame runs into Iruka, noting he hasn't been to Ramen Ichiraku in a while. Iruka explains he's still trying to figure out what to say. Naruto visits Iruka, asking him out for ramen. Iruka is trying to cook his own dinner, without much success. Naruto wants to have fun in his last days as a single man, and Iruka scolds him for it. Naruto wants to go out with him to tell him something. Iruka wonders why he struggled so much with his message. Naruto asks Iruka to attend the ceremony as his father, moving him. Iruka accepts. Iruka and Hinata talk about Naruto's request. Iruka records another message with Konohamaru, finally getting it right. The guests arrive for the reception and mingle. Hinata looks up to the sky thinking of Neji, while Naruto is looking at his father's face at the Hokage Rock. Hanabi and Hiashi inform them that the ceremony is about to begin, and while Hanabi comments on her sister's beautiful appearance, Hiashi is overwhelmed with emotion about his daughter getting married. Hinata holds Naruto's hand, who then asks if she is ready, and the two prepare to get married.",
